<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: Roadmap phase 1, Foundations to first handshake. -->

# Phase 1: Foundations to first handshake

**Done when:** The retail client, started with -L 127.0.0.1 12000 -P 0, completes SessionOffer/SessionAccept with Ambrose loginserver and stays connected. The server log names its MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (7:27).

## Review notes for this phase

The roadmap critic flagged these. Resolve each one before or while implementing the milestones it names.

- **Decision 2026-09-16.** To fit the included Actions minutes of a private repository, 1.04's build legs no longer run on every push or pull request. Checks run daily, on pushes that change CI files and on pull requests. A push or pull request that changes a CI build input also builds Linux GCC. Other builds run on a schedule when code changed, by label or on demand. The ccache/sccache deliverable is dropped because runs are days apart. 1.04's goal, spec summary and matrix deliverable below are superseded where they say every push or PR builds. See Continuous integration in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **Decision 2026-09-13.** Protocol definitions load at runtime (see Decisions in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md). 1.15 becomes the runtime `MessageRegistry` loader plus startup-validated message declarations instead of a build-time generator, and 1.16 tests it against project-authored fixtures, with real-install checks under the `client` CTest label. 1.04 CI therefore needs no client files. Dependencies come from vcpkg manifest mode rather than vendored copies, which replaces the `deps/fmt` and `deps/gtest` deliverables in 1.01 and 1.02.

- **Ordering.** 1.04 CI is built and made mandatory before the 'how CI builds without client files' decision is taken, and before 1.15 msggen makes the build client-dependent. Either 1.04 depends on that decision or CI is rebuilt at 1.15. **Resolved:** the 2026-09-13 decision loads protocol data at runtime, so CI builds and tests without client files and 1.15 needs no CI rebuild.
- **Missing work.** Automated headless test client/bot harness that replays scripted sessions. Almost every acceptance is 'Real client' and not repeatable in CI. 1.22 has a fake client, but nothing grows it into a regression harness. **Planned in 3.24**, added on 2026-09-17: a driver launches the maintainer's own retail client windowed against a scratch server, drives it with window messages, captures its window and reports every message the server did not handle. It runs where a client is installed and skips elsewhere, so the fake client stays the CI regression harness.
- **Missing work.** Codestyle checker (1.03) does not check the mandatory one-line brief, the Markdown/SQL/Batch/YAML header forms, or the JSON exemption from ARCHITECTURE.md. **Resolved in 1.03:** the checker validates the brief and every header form in the Conventions table, exempts JSON, and rejects file types it has no rule for.
- **Correction 2026-09-17, from the first retail client session.** The client ends its KeepAlive frames without the trailing byte every other frame carries: `0d f0 0a 00`, the control header `01 03 00 00` and the 6 body bytes. Reading the last body byte as the trailer made 1.22 close every session 10 seconds after login. The client also counts the KeepAlive Milliseconds field past 999 (14097 in minute 11), so that field is not milliseconds into the second. **Resolved:** ControlMessages reads a client KeepAlive with or without the trailing byte, covered by ControlMessagesTest and SessionBaseTest, and the real client stayed connected.
- **Missing work 2026-09-17, from the first retail client session.** On every SessionOffer the client logs `Session::ParseEncryption -- Bad blockLen = 0`. It reads a length-prefixed encryption block after the 14 offer body bytes, and Ambrose sends none. The client carries on and logs in, but the block and what the client does with it are not decoded. Planned, not yet scheduled: decode the block from the client's own handling and send the one it expects.
- **Correction.** 1.14's reason for the 253 GAME ids is incomplete. GameMessages.xml also has 254 tags / 253 ids because MSG_REMOVEOBJECT is duplicated, and the two copies have different descriptions. The totals 1448/1446 are still correct. **Resolved in 1.14:** duplicate tags merge by matching fields, and descriptions may differ.
- **Correction.** 1.14 fixture 'untyped GlobalID' is incomplete. Three untyped fields exist: MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS.GlobalID (no TYPE), MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB.Force (TPYE typo), and MSG_BATTLEGROUNDQUEUEUPDATE.Kicked (attribute 'TYP', WizardMessages2). Add a 'TYP' fixture. **Resolved in 1.14:** the TYP fixture and client check exist, and the Message definition quirks decision in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md keeps all three fields on the wire.
- **Correction.** UNVERIFIED, not wrong: 1.21/phase 1 outcome rely on a '-P 0' client launch flag. No local source documents it (Imlight README.md:79 documents only '-L 127.0.0.1 12000'). Also unverified: TemplateManifest 137423 entries, 134076 BINd, 42 ItemSetBonusTemplate rows, 16 magic_school_template rows, CombatSigil8Actor's 8 sub-circles, and the traffic.log line citations.

## 1.01 Toolchain hello (FND-1)

**Goal:** Configure, build, genrev and run on Windows and Linux.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** nothing

**Acceptance**

- [x] Windows and linux-gcc presets build with no warnings
- [x] gameserver prints 'Project Ambrose rev <shorthash> (<branch>) <date>' matching git rev-parse --short HEAD
- [x] Build without .git prints 'rev unknown'

### Detailed spec from FND-1: Toolchain hello: CMake + fmt + genrev + one app that prints its revision

Prove the whole toolchain works: configure, vendored dep, static lib, generated header, executable, on Windows and Linux.

**Deliverables**

- CMakeLists.txt (root): project(Ambrose CXX), C++20 required, options (BUILD_TESTING, TOOLS, APPS_BUILD), adds deps/ src/
- CMakePresets.json: windows-msvc-x64, linux-gcc, linux-clang with Debug/RelWithDebInfo (JSON, exempt from the header rule)
- src/cmake/: CompilerFlags.cmake (MSVC /W4 /permissive- /utf-8, GCC/Clang -Wall -Wextra), PlatformDetect.cmake, AmbroseMacros.cmake (ambrose_add_library helper that globs a folder and sets include dirs)
- deps/fmt/ (vendored release, with its own CMakeLists) plus deps/CMakeLists.txt
- src/genrev/CMakeLists.txt + GenRev.cmake: at build time runs `git rev-parse --short HEAD`, branch and commit date into build/src/genrev/GitRevision.h, with fallback values when git is absent (source tarball)
- src/common/GitRevision.h/.cpp: GitRevision::GetHash/GetBranch/GetDate/GetFullVersion()
- src/common/Banner.h/.cpp: Ambrose::Banner::Show(appName, logFn)
- src/server/apps/gameserver/Main.cpp: prints the banner and GetFullVersion(), exits 0

**Acceptance**

- [x] `cmake --preset windows-msvc-x64 && cmake --build` and the linux-gcc preset both finish with no warnings
- [x] gameserver prints 'Project Ambrose rev <shorthash> (<branch>) <date>' and the hash matches `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
- [x] Changing HEAD (new commit) and rebuilding regenerates GitRevision.h without a clean build
- [x] Building from an exported tree without .git prints 'rev unknown' and does not fail
- [x] Real client: nothing observable (no networking yet)

**Risks**

- Settled on 2026-09-13: dependencies, fmt included, come from vcpkg manifest mode instead of vendored copies (see Stack in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Generated header must be regenerated per build without forcing a full rebuild (use configure_file with copy_if_different)

## 1.02 Unit test harness (FND-2)

**Goal:** One unit_tests exe run by CTest.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.01

**Acceptance**

- [x] ctest passes GitRevisionTest on both presets
- [x] A failing test makes ctest exit non-zero
- [x] -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF configures without gtest

### Detailed spec from FND-2: Unit test harness

Every later milestone can add GoogleTest tests that CTest runs from one executable.

**Deliverables**

- deps/gtest/ vendored (GoogleTest + GoogleMock)
- src/test/CMakeLists.txt: single `unit_tests` target, sources globbed from src/test/** mirroring src/, linked to common (later shared, database, game)
- src/test/main.cpp (gtest_main or own main that sets up test logging later)
- src/test/common/GitRevisionTest.cpp
- src/test/mocks/ folder with CMake wiring for gmock helpers
- ctest registration via gtest_discover_tests

**Acceptance**

- [x] `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` runs and passes GitRevisionTest on both presets
- [x] A deliberately failing test makes ctest exit non-zero
- [x] -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF configures without gtest
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- GoogleTest and GoogleMock were chosen on 2026-09-13 (see Stack in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md); gtest_discover_tests needs the exe runnable at build time (cross builds)

## 1.03 Codestyle checker (FND-3)

**Goal:** Reject a missing branding header or any other comment.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.01

**Acceptance**

- [x] The current tree passes
- [x] `int x = 1; // note` fails; `auto s = "http://x";` and `R"(/* x */)"` pass
- [x] SQL `-- extra` fails; `SELECT '--';` passes
- [x] A .h without an AMBROSE_ guard fails

### Detailed spec from FND-3: Codestyle checker: branding header and no other comments

A tool rejects any file that lacks the exact Project Ambrose header for its type or has any other comment.

**Deliverables**

- apps/codestyle/codestyle.py (Python 3, header '# Project Ambrose by Imjustchico' + brief); Python was settled for repository tooling on 2026-09-13 (see Tools in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Per-type rules taken from doc/ARCHITECTURE.md Conventions table: C/C++ (`/*`, ` * Project Ambrose by Imjustchico`, ` * <non-empty brief>`, ` */`), # family (CMake, sh, ps1, py, yml, conf/.conf.dist, .gitignore/.gitattributes/.editorconfig), SQL `--`, Batch `REM`, Markdown `<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: <brief> -->`; JSON exempt
- Comment lexers that respect string literals: C++ `//` and `/* */` outside "...", '...' and raw strings R"d(...)d"; SQL `--`/`/* */` outside quotes; CMake `#` and `#[[ ]]` outside quoted args; shell/Python `#` outside quotes, with shebang allowed on line 1 before the header; Batch `REM`/`::`; Markdown `<!-- -->`
- Excludes: deps/**, build*/**, .git/**, empty .gitkeep files, generated build/src/genrev
- Extra checks: LF endings except .bat/.ps1 (matches .editorconfig/.gitattributes), trailing whitespace, final newline, include guard `AMBROSE_<FILE>_H` in .h
- apps/codestyle/tests/ fixtures (good/bad samples) + test runner
- Exit code 0/1 with file:line messages; `--fix-header` is planned, not yet scheduled, as an opt-in experimental option that inserts the header form for a file's type around a brief the caller supplies, because headers need a human-written brief

**Acceptance**

- [x] Running on the current  tree passes (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CLAUDE.md, doc/ARCHITECTURE.md, .gitignore, .editorconfig, .gitattributes all have valid headers today)
- [x] Fixture: `int x = 1; // note` fails at its line; `auto s = "http://x";` passes; `R"(/* x */)"` passes
- [x] Fixture: SQL file with `-- extra` after the header fails; `SELECT '--';` passes
- [x] Fixture: header brief empty or misspelled branding fails
- [x] Fixture: a .h without AMBROSE_ guard fails
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- The no-comments rule conflicts with AzerothCore-style commented .conf.dist files, and with Doxygen or license text in vendored deps (deps/ must be excluded)
- A lexer that misreads C++ raw strings, digit separators (1'000) or character literals gives false positives
- Python in apps/ does not clash with 'Server code is C++' in CLAUDE.md: settled on 2026-09-13, repository tooling in apps/ may be Python or shell (see Tools in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 1.04 CI pipeline (FND-4)

**Goal:** Build, test, style and forbidden-file scan on every PR. Superseded on 2026-09-16: every PR still gets the style, forbidden-file and trailer checks, and builds run on a schedule, by label or on demand (see the decision note above)

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.02, 1.03

**Acceptance**

- [x] `// todo` in a .cpp fails codestyle (dispatch run 34771249175)
- [x] A file beginning 'KIWAD' fails ci-forbidden-files
- [x] A commit without an AI trailer fails
- [x] A clean PR is green on all 3 legs (verified on push run 34771622038, which runs the same jobs a pull request does; the pull request commit range is covered by ci.selftest)

### Detailed spec from FND-4: CI pipeline

Every push and PR builds, tests, style-checks and scans for forbidden content on Windows and Linux. Superseded on 2026-09-16: see the decision note above and Continuous integration in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md.

**Deliverables**

- .github/workflows/core-build.yml (GitHub requires this location; logic lives in apps/ci scripts)
- apps/ci/ci-build.sh and ci-build.ps1: configure with preset, build, ctest
- apps/ci/ci-codestyle.sh: runs apps/codestyle
- apps/ci/ci-forbidden-files.py: fails on *.wad, *.pcap(ng), files starting with 'KIWAD' or 'BINd', any committed copy of a client protocol XML (root element <...Messages> with <_ProtocolInfo>), the wiztype dump JSON shape ({version, classes}), .conf files (not .dist), and any file over a size limit outside deps/
- apps/ci/ci-commit-trailer.py: every commit in the PR has a Co-Authored-By AI trailer (CONTRIBUTING.md requirement)
- Build matrix: windows-latest MSVC, ubuntu-latest GCC and Clang; ccache/sccache caching. The matrix now also holds the sanitizer and fuzz legs and is chosen per run; ccache/sccache was dropped on 2026-09-16, and a vcpkg binary cache per operating system remains

**Acceptance**

- [x] A PR that adds `// todo` to a .cpp fails the codestyle job
- [x] A PR that commits a file beginning with bytes 'KIWAD' fails ci-forbidden-files
- [x] A commit without an AI trailer fails ci-commit-trailer
- [x] A clean PR is green on all three matrix legs with unit_tests executed (push run 34771622038: windows-msvc-x64 on Visual Studio 18 2026, linux-gcc, and linux-clang each ran 8/8 tests)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Private repo: GitHub Actions minutes are limited, especially Windows runners
- Pre-existing local pre-push hook (CLAUDE.local.md) must not conflict with CI assumptions

## 1.05 common/Utilities (FND-5)

**Goal:** Time, random, strings, TokenBucket.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.02

**Acceptance**

- [x] StringTo<uint32>("4294967296") is nullopt
- [x] GetMSTimeDiff handles uint32 wrap
- [x] TokenBucket refills on a fake clock

### Detailed spec from FND-5: common/Utilities: time, random, strings, safe parsing

Shared helpers every subsystem needs exist and are tested.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Utilities/Timer.h: GameTime-style steady clock helpers (GetMSTime, GetMSTimeDiff with wraparound), IntervalTimer, TimeTracker
- src/common/Utilities/Duration.h: Milliseconds/Seconds/Minutes aliases
- src/common/Utilities/Random.h/.cpp: thread-local engine, urand/irand/frand/roll_chance, RandomEngine satisfying UniformRandomBitGenerator
- src/common/Utilities/StringUtil.h/.cpp: Tokenize (string_view), Trim, ASCII ToLower/ToUpper, case-insensitive compare, StringTo<T> via from_chars returning std::optional, fmt-based StringFormat
- src/common/Utilities/EnumFlag.h, Optional/Types.h (uint8..uint64, int8..int64 aliases)
- src/common/Utilities/TokenBucket.h: rate limiter (the reference server has one in Shared/Networking/TokenBucket.cs; behavior only)
- src/test/common/Utilities/*Test.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] StringTo<uint32>("4294967296") is nullopt; StringTo<int32>("-5") == -5
- [x] GetMSTimeDiff handles a uint32 wrap
- [x] Tokenize("a  b", ' ', keepEmpty=false) gives {a,b}
- [x] urand(1,1)==1; 10^6 draws of urand(0,9) stay within range
- [x] TokenBucket allows N tokens and refills on a fake clock
- [x] Real client: n/a

## 1.06 ByteBuffer and DML primitives (FND-6 + NET-1)

**Goal:** Bounds-checked LE read/write for BYT UBYT USHRT INT UINT FLT GID STR WSTR.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.05

**Acceptance**

- [x] Round-trip per type incl. NaN FLT and GID 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
- [x] STR length past the end throws and allocates nothing
- [x] WSTR 'Ab' encodes as 02 00 41 00 62 00
- [x] Random-truncation fuzz is clean under ASan

### Detailed spec from FND-6: common/Encoding: byte buffer, bit stream, text encodings

Bounds-checked little-endian primitives cover every DML field type in the client XML and every bit-width type in the ObjectProperty dump.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Encoding/ByteBuffer.h/.cpp: growable LE buffer, typed Read/Write for uint8/int8/uint16/int16/uint32/int32/uint64/int64/float/double, read position, throws ByteBufferException on overrun (never an unchecked allocation from a length prefix)
- DML helpers (possibly promoted to shared/Messages by NET): STR = uint16 length + bytes, WSTR = uint16 code-unit count + UTF-16LE, GID = uint64. The 9 TYPE values seen across all 26 Root.wad *Messages.xml files: STR, GID, UINT, INT, UBYT, FLT, BYT, WSTR, USHRT (no DBL)
- src/common/Encoding/BitStream.h/.cpp: BitReader/BitWriter, LSB-first, arbitrary widths 1-64, byte realign, needed for type-dump primitives bui2, bui4, bui5, bui7, s24, u24 and bool
- src/common/Encoding/Utf.h/.cpp: UTF-8 <-> UTF-16LE with invalid-sequence handling (Locale .lang files and WSTR/std::wstring are UTF-16)
- src/common/Encoding/Base64.h, Hex.h
- src/test/common/Encoding/*Test.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] Round-trip each DML type; reading a STR whose length prefix passes the buffer end throws and allocates nothing
- [x] BitWriter write(0b101,3), write(0x7F,7), realign produces the expected bytes; BitReader reads the same values; s24 sign-extends -1 (delivered in 1.07)
- [x] UTF-8 'Wizardé\U0001F600' -> UTF-16LE -> UTF-8 is identical; an unpaired surrogate is replaced or rejected (documented) (delivered in 1.08)
- [x] Base64 matches RFC 4648 vectors (delivered in 1.08)
- [x] Optional integration test: `ClientDataTest.LocaleLangEntryDecodesAsUtf16` decodes one `Locale/*.lang` entry from the user's Root.wad without error (`client_tests.exe --gtest_filter=ClientDataTest.LocaleLangEntryDecodesAsUtf16`, Windows/MSVC, 2026-09-23)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Bit order (LSB-first) for ObjectProperty is inferred from the reference codec, not yet checked against a capture; OBJ must confirm it
- Whether WSTR's length is a code-unit or byte count must be checked against a real capture by NET

### Detailed spec from NET-1: DML primitive codec and ByteBuffer

Every one of the 9 wire field types used by the client XML can be read and written with bounds checks.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Utilities/ByteBuffer.h/.cpp: little-endian growable buffer with read cursor, and a ByteBufferException on underflow
- src/server/shared/Messages/DmlTypes.h: DmlType enum {BYT,UBYT,USHRT,INT,UINT,FLT,GID,STR,WSTR} with wire sizes. BYT=i8, UBYT=u8, USHRT=u16, INT=i32, UINT=u32, FLT=IEEE754 f32, GID=u64. STR=u16 byte count + raw bytes (std::string, may hold binary ObjectProperty blobs). WSTR=u16 UTF-16 code-unit count + 2*count bytes UTF-16LE (std::u16string)
- Also accepted as aliases, not used in r806919 XML: SHRT, DBL, BOOL, UBYTE, USHORT, all reported as warnings
- src/test/common/Utilities/ByteBufferTest.cpp, src/test/server/shared/Messages/DmlTypesTest.cpp

**Data sources**

- None (pure code). Encodings verified against Imcodec.IO BitWriter.WriteString/WriteWString and BitReader.ReadString/ReadWString (non-compact path)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Round-trip test per type, including min/max values, NaN for FLT, and 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF for GID
- [x] STR of 0 bytes encodes as 00 00; STR of 65535 bytes round-trips; a length prefix larger than the remaining bytes throws and does not allocate
- [x] WSTR 'Ab' encodes as 02 00 41 00 62 00 (the count is code units, not bytes)
- [x] Reading past the end throws; the fuzz-style test (random truncation of valid buffers) never crashes under ASan

**Risks**

- STR carries arbitrary bytes. Never transcode it as UTF-8, or ObjectProperty blobs get corrupted

## 1.07 BitReader/BitWriter (OBJ-1 + FND-6)

**Goal:** LSB-first KI bit streams with back-patching.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.05

**Acceptance**

- [x] bit 1, u32 0xAABBCCDD, 3 bits 0b101 gives 01 DD CC BB AA 05
- [x] s24 -2 and bui5 31 round-trip
- [x] Read past end sets failed flag, no crash

### Detailed spec from OBJ-1: Bit stream reader and writer

Any code can read and write KI bit-packed streams exactly as the client does, safely on truncated or hostile input.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Serialization/BitReader.h/.cpp: LSB-first bit order within each byte; byte-aligned little-endian u8/i8/u16/i16/u32/i32/u64/i64/f32/f64 (these realign to the next byte); ReadBits(n) for 1..32 bits (bool = 1 bit, bui2/bui4/bui5/bui7, s24/u24 with sign extension); raw byte spans; BitPos/SeekBit; every read bounds-checked and returning a failure state instead of throwing or causing UB
- src/common/Serialization/BitWriter.h/.cpp: the matching writes, SeekBit back-patching (needed for the versionable size fields), growable buffer
- src/test/common/Serialization/BitStreamTest.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test: writing bit 1, then u32 0xAABBCCDD, then 3 bits 0b101 produces the hand-derived bytes 01 DD CC BB AA 05, and reads back identically
- [x] Unit test: s24 value -2 round-trips; bui5 31 round-trips; mixed bool/u16 sequences realign correctly
- [x] Unit test: reading past the end sets a failed flag, returns zeros and never crashes (run under ASan/UBSan in CI)
- [x] Unit test: back-patching a u32 at an earlier bit position rewrites it exactly

**Risks**

- Bit order is easy to get backwards. It was verified against Root.wad BINd files and captured blobs, so both directions must be pinned by golden tests

### Detailed spec from FND-6: common/Encoding: byte buffer, bit stream, text encodings

Bounds-checked little-endian primitives cover every DML field type in the client XML and every bit-width type in the ObjectProperty dump.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Encoding/ByteBuffer.h/.cpp: growable LE buffer, typed Read/Write for uint8/int8/uint16/int16/uint32/int32/uint64/int64/float/double, read position, throws ByteBufferException on overrun (never an unchecked allocation from a length prefix)
- DML helpers (possibly promoted to shared/Messages by NET): STR = uint16 length + bytes, WSTR = uint16 code-unit count + UTF-16LE, GID = uint64. The 9 TYPE values seen across all 26 Root.wad *Messages.xml files: STR, GID, UINT, INT, UBYT, FLT, BYT, WSTR, USHRT (no DBL)
- src/common/Encoding/BitStream.h/.cpp: BitReader/BitWriter, LSB-first, arbitrary widths 1-64, byte realign, needed for type-dump primitives bui2, bui4, bui5, bui7, s24, u24 and bool
- src/common/Encoding/Utf.h/.cpp: UTF-8 <-> UTF-16LE with invalid-sequence handling (Locale .lang files and WSTR/std::wstring are UTF-16)
- src/common/Encoding/Base64.h, Hex.h
- src/test/common/Encoding/*Test.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] Round-trip each DML type; reading a STR whose length prefix passes the buffer end throws and allocates nothing (delivered in 1.06)
- [x] BitWriter write(0b101,3), write(0x7F,7), realign produces the expected bytes; BitReader reads the same values; s24 sign-extends -1
- [x] UTF-8 'Wizardé\U0001F600' -> UTF-16LE -> UTF-8 is identical; an unpaired surrogate is replaced or rejected (documented) (delivered in 1.08)
- [x] Base64 matches RFC 4648 vectors (delivered in 1.08)
- [x] Optional integration test: `ClientDataTest.LocaleLangEntryDecodesAsUtf16` decodes one `Locale/*.lang` entry from the user's Root.wad without error (client_tests, run on the pinned install, 2026-09-23)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Bit order (LSB-first) for ObjectProperty is inferred from the reference codec, not yet checked against a capture; OBJ must confirm it
- Whether WSTR's length is a code-unit or byte count must be checked against a real capture by NET

## 1.08 UTF-8/UTF-16, Base64, Hex (FND-6)

**Goal:** Text encodings for .lang and WSTR.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.05

**Acceptance**

- [x] UTF-8 'Wizardé\U0001F600' round-trips via UTF-16LE
- [x] Base64 matches RFC 4648 vectors

### Detailed spec from FND-6: common/Encoding: byte buffer, bit stream, text encodings

Bounds-checked little-endian primitives cover every DML field type in the client XML and every bit-width type in the ObjectProperty dump.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Encoding/ByteBuffer.h/.cpp: growable LE buffer, typed Read/Write for uint8/int8/uint16/int16/uint32/int32/uint64/int64/float/double, read position, throws ByteBufferException on overrun (never an unchecked allocation from a length prefix)
- DML helpers (possibly promoted to shared/Messages by NET): STR = uint16 length + bytes, WSTR = uint16 code-unit count + UTF-16LE, GID = uint64. The 9 TYPE values seen across all 26 Root.wad *Messages.xml files: STR, GID, UINT, INT, UBYT, FLT, BYT, WSTR, USHRT (no DBL)
- src/common/Encoding/BitStream.h/.cpp: BitReader/BitWriter, LSB-first, arbitrary widths 1-64, byte realign, needed for type-dump primitives bui2, bui4, bui5, bui7, s24, u24 and bool
- src/common/Encoding/Utf.h/.cpp: UTF-8 <-> UTF-16LE with invalid-sequence handling (Locale .lang files and WSTR/std::wstring are UTF-16)
- src/common/Encoding/Base64.h, Hex.h
- src/test/common/Encoding/*Test.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] Round-trip each DML type; reading a STR whose length prefix passes the buffer end throws and allocates nothing (delivered in 1.06)
- [x] BitWriter write(0b101,3), write(0x7F,7), realign produces the expected bytes; BitReader reads the same values; s24 sign-extends -1 (delivered in 1.07)
- [x] UTF-8 'Wizardé\U0001F600' -> UTF-16LE -> UTF-8 is identical; an unpaired surrogate is replaced or rejected (documented)
- [x] Base64 matches RFC 4648 vectors
- [x] Optional integration test: `ClientDataTest.LocaleLangEntryDecodesAsUtf16` decodes one `Locale/*.lang` entry from the user's Root.wad without error (client_tests, run on the pinned install, 2026-09-23)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Bit order (LSB-first) for ObjectProperty is inferred from the reference codec, not yet checked against a capture; OBJ must confirm it
- Whether WSTR's length is a code-unit or byte count must be checked against a real capture by NET

## 1.09 ConfigMgr (FND-9)

**Goal:** Typed options from .conf.dist/.conf/env.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.05

**Acceptance**

- [x] AMBROSE_WORLD_SERVER_PORT env override works
- [x] `Foo == bar` fails with its line number
- [x] Reload() picks up changes

### Detailed spec from FND-9: common/Configuration: ConfigMgr and .conf.dist convention

Apps read typed options from <app>.conf, falling back to .conf.dist defaults, with environment overrides.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Configuration/Config.h/.cpp: sConfigMgr singleton, LoadInitial(file, args), Reload(), GetOption<T>(name, default, quiet) for bool/int types/float/string, GetKeysByString(prefix) for Appender.* / Logger.*
- Parser: `Key = value`, quoted strings, `#` lines (header only, per codestyle), duplicate-key error, unknown-line error with line number
- Override order: .conf.dist < .conf < conf.d/*.conf < env vars AMBROSE_<KEY_UPPER_UNDERSCORED>
- Missing key logs one warning (after logging exists; buffered until then)
- CMake: install/copy each app's <app>.conf.dist next to the binary (etc/ in install)
- conf/dist/: CMake config template (config.cmake.dist) and env template (env.dist) per ARCHITECTURE 'Build and environment config templates'
- src/test/common/Configuration/ConfigTest.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] GetOption<uint32>("WorldServerPort", 12000) returns the file value, default when missing, and env value when AMBROSE_WORLD_SERVER_PORT is set
- [x] Malformed line `Foo == bar` fails load with line number
- [x] Reload() picks up a changed file
- [x] `bool` accepts 1/0/true/false case-insensitively
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- No-comments rule: .conf.dist cannot document options inline like AzerothCore's does; option documentation needs another home (doc/ or a generated table)
- Env-var name mangling rules must be decided once and documented

## 1.10 Logging (FND-10)

**Goal:** Named loggers and appenders from config.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.09

**Acceptance**

- [x] Logger.sql.sql at Warn drops LOG_INFO while root Info prints
- [x] A format mismatch is a compile error
- [x] File appender writes Server.log

### Detailed spec from FND-10: common/Logging: loggers, appenders, levels from config

All code logs through named loggers configured by Appender.* and Logger.* options.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Logging/Log.h/.cpp: sLog, LOG_TRACE/DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR/FATAL(filter, fmtstr, args...) using fmt compile-time checked formats
- Logger hierarchy by dotted name ('server.loginserver', 'network.opcode', 'sql.sql', 'sql.updates') inheriting from the nearest parent
- Appender.h, AppenderConsole (colored per level, Windows console too), AppenderFile (per-name file, optional timestamped filename, flush policy)
- Config format: `Appender.Console = 1,3,0` (type,level,flags,...) and `Logger.root = 3,Console Server` in each .conf.dist
- Optional async mode on an owned thread (Threading ProducerConsumerQueue arrives in FND-11; add async there or keep sync here)
- Test appender capturing messages for unit tests (src/test/mocks)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Logger.sql.sql at level Warn drops LOG_INFO("sql.sql", ...) while Logger.root at Info still prints server.* messages
- [x] A format string/argument mismatch is a compile error
- [x] File appender writes Server.log in LogsDir with the expected line prefix (time, level, logger)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Mixing sync and async logging at shutdown can lose the last lines; flush on exit must be tested

## 1.11 Threading and Asio wrappers (FND-11)

**Goal:** Queues, pools, timers, resolver.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.05

**Acceptance**

- [x] 4x100k producer/consumer exactly-once; Cancel wakes consumers
- [x] DeadlineTimer fires; cancel prevents it
- [x] TSan clean

### Detailed spec from FND-11: common/Threading and common/Asio wrappers

Thread-safe queues, worker threads and thin Asio wrappers that network and database code build on.

**Deliverables**

- Settled on 2026-09-13: standalone Asio with no Boost, from vcpkg (see Stack in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- src/common/Threading/ProducerConsumerQueue.h: blocking Pop with Cancel, WaitAndPop
- src/common/Threading/ThreadPool.h (named threads running one asio::io_context; asio::thread_pool was not used because attaching named threads to it races with join), ThreadName helper, LockedQueue.h, MPSCQueue.h
- src/common/Asio/IoContext.h, Strand.h, DeadlineTimer.h, Resolver.h (IPv4/IPv6 resolve to endpoint), IpAddress.h (parse, is-loopback), SignalSet helper
- src/test/common/Threading/*Test.cpp, src/test/common/Asio/*Test.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] ProducerConsumerQueue: 4 producers × 100k items, 4 consumers, all items consumed exactly once; Cancel wakes blocked consumers
- [x] DeadlineTimer fires on an io_context within tolerance; cancel prevents the handler
- [x] Resolver resolves 'localhost' to loopback
- [x] ThreadSanitizer (linux-clang preset with -fsanitize=thread) run of these tests is clean
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Standalone Asio was chosen before NET started, which fixed include paths and error_code types for every networking file (see Stack in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 1.12 Crypto basics: SHA-256/512, CRC32 both variants, CSPRNG (FND-7 + PAT-2 Crc32)

**Goal:** Hash and checksum primitives with known-answer tests.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.06

**Acceptance**

- [x] SHA-256('abc')=ba7816bf...; SHA-512('abc')=ddaf35a1...
- [x] CRC32('123456789') init 0xFFFFFFFF + final xor = 0xCBF43926
- [x] KI variant (init 0, no xor) = 0x2DFD2D88 (verified)
- [x] Incremental equals one-shot

### Detailed spec from FND-7: common/Cryptography part 1: hashes, CRC32, CSPRNG

The hash and checksum primitives login and patch flows need are available with known-answer tests.

**Deliverables**

- Settled on 2026-09-13: Botan 3 from vcpkg for SHA-2 and the random number generator, with the client's CRC-32 implemented in common (see Stack in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- src/common/Cryptography/SHA256.h/.cpp, SHA512.h/.cpp: incremental Update/Finalize
- src/common/Cryptography/CRC32.h/.cpp: reflected polynomial 0xEDB88320 with caller-supplied initial value (the reference uses both Calculate(0,...) for patch file lists and ~crc for WAD segments)
- src/common/Cryptography/CryptoRandom.h: GetRandomBytes via OS CSPRNG
- src/common/Cryptography/ConstantTime.h: constant-time equal
- src/test/common/Cryptography/*Test.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] SHA-256('abc') = ba7816bf...; SHA-512('abc') = ddaf35a1... (FIPS 180-4 vectors)
- [x] CRC32('123456789') with init 0xFFFFFFFF and final xor = 0xCBF43926
- [ ] Optional integration test with AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR: a KIWAD entry's stored crc field matches CRC32 of its stored bytes (tells us which init/xor variant KIWAD uses) (moved to 1.13, which adds the archive reader)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Botan 3 was chosen instead of system OpenSSL, so the crypto library comes from vcpkg on every platform
- Which CRC variant KIWAD entries use is not verified (the reference uses different init values in different places)

### Detailed spec from PAT-2: KI CRC-32 and KIWAD header measurement primitives

The server can compute the exact CRC, HeaderSize and HeaderCRC values the client checks files against.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Utilities/Crc32.h/.cpp: table-driven reflected CRC-32, poly 0xEDB88320, init 0, no final XOR, streaming update API
- src/server/shared/Archive/KiwadHeader.h/.cpp: reads 'KIWAD' magic, version, count, optional flag byte (version>=2), 21+nameLen per entry, returns TOC byte length (reuses or feeds the shared KIWAD reader from DAT/WLD if that exists first)
- src/test/common/Utilities/Crc32Test.cpp, src/test/server/shared/Archive/KiwadHeaderTest.cpp

**Data sources**

- Verified against Aurorium data/V_r806919.Wizard_1_610/LatestFileList.xml: CRC matches for sampled files, HeaderSize == KIWAD TOC length for all 3589 type 3/5 WADs, HeaderCRC == CRC(first HeaderSize bytes)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: Crc32("123456789") == 0x2DFD2D88 (this variant; zlib's standard value 0xCBF43926 must NOT be produced)
- [x] Unit: incremental update over split buffers equals one-shot result
- [ ] Unit: synthetic in-memory KIWAD v2 with 3 entries yields TOC length 14 + sum(21+nameLen) (moved to 1.13, which adds the KIWAD reader)
- [ ] Env-gated test (AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR set, skipped otherwise): for every Data/GameData/*.wad in the user's install, KiwadHeader length is <= file size and parsing never over-reads (moved to 1.13, which adds the KIWAD reader)

**Risks**

- KIWAD reader may be duplicated with the DAT/WLD domain; agree on one shared/Archive owner

## 1.13 zlib Compression and KIWAD archive reader (new DAT-1; FND-8 zlib, PAT-2 KiwadHeader)

**Goal:** Read the user's WAD entries and inflate them with a size cap.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.12, 1.10

**Acceptance**

- [x] Inflate past cap fails cleanly
- [x] Synthetic KIWAD v2 with 3 entries gives TOC length 14 + sum(21+nameLen)
- [x] Client-gated: Root.wad lists 173088 entries (verified); LoginMessages.xml inflates; a flags-15 BINd inflates at offset 13
- [x] Client-gated: header parse never over-reads on any GameData/*.wad
- [x] Optional integration test moved from 1.08: decode the UTF-16 text of one Locale/*.lang entry from the user's Root.wad without error, skipped unless AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR is set
- [x] Optional integration test moved from 1.12: a KIWAD entry's stored CRC equals Crc32 of its stored bytes, which confirms the client variant, skipped unless AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR is set

### Detailed spec from FND-8: common/Cryptography part 2: Twofish-OFB; common/Utilities: zlib

The cipher used for Rec1 in MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP / MSG_USER_VALIDATE exists, and zlib-compressed client data can be inflated.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Cryptography/Twofish.h/.cpp: written from the published Twofish spec (OpenSSL does not ship Twofish), 128-bit key block encrypt, plus an OFB mode wrapper with no padding
- deps/zlib/ vendored; src/common/Utilities/Compression.h/.cpp: Inflate(expectedSize) with a hard output cap, Deflate
- src/test/common/Cryptography/TwofishTest.cpp, src/test/common/Utilities/CompressionTest.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] Twofish-128 matches the spec's published known-answer vectors (zero key and plaintext, and the iterated table)
- [x] OFB encrypt then decrypt is identity for 0, 1, 15, 16, 17 and 1000 bytes
- [x] Inflate of a stream that decompresses past its cap fails cleanly (zip bomb guard)
- [x] Optional integration with AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR: inflate a compressed Root.wad entry (e.g. LoginMessages.xml) and, for a 'BINd' entry, the zlib payload at offset 13
- [x] Real client: n/a (NET checks Rec1 against a live login)

**Risks**

- Twofish key and nonce derivation for Rec1 is NET's job; FND only guarantees the cipher is correct
- LoginMessages.xml fields PassKey3 and Rec1 exist (checked), but the exact hashing the client does is only known from the reference server and is unverified against a capture

### Detailed spec from PAT-2: KI CRC-32 and KIWAD header measurement primitives

The server can compute the exact CRC, HeaderSize and HeaderCRC values the client checks files against.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Utilities/Crc32.h/.cpp: table-driven reflected CRC-32, poly 0xEDB88320, init 0, no final XOR, streaming update API
- src/server/shared/Archive/KiwadHeader.h/.cpp: reads 'KIWAD' magic, version, count, optional flag byte (version>=2), 21+nameLen per entry, returns TOC byte length (reuses or feeds the shared KIWAD reader from DAT/WLD if that exists first)
- src/test/common/Utilities/Crc32Test.cpp, src/test/server/shared/Archive/KiwadHeaderTest.cpp

**Data sources**

- Verified against Aurorium data/V_r806919.Wizard_1_610/LatestFileList.xml: CRC matches for sampled files, HeaderSize == KIWAD TOC length for all 3589 type 3/5 WADs, HeaderCRC == CRC(first HeaderSize bytes)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: Crc32("123456789") == 0x2DFD2D88 (this variant; zlib's standard value 0xCBF43926 must NOT be produced)
- [x] Unit: incremental update over split buffers equals one-shot result
- [x] Unit: synthetic in-memory KIWAD v2 with 3 entries yields TOC length 14 + sum(21+nameLen)
- [x] Env-gated test (AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR set, skipped otherwise): for every Data/GameData/*.wad in the user's install, KiwadHeader length is <= file size and parsing never over-reads

**Risks**

- KIWAD reader may be duplicated with the DAT/WLD domain; agree on one shared/Archive owner

## 1.14 Message definition model and ordinal rules (NET-2)

**Goal:** Client XML text becomes validated protocols with wire ids.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.06, 1.13

**Client messages:** MSG_PING, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_BADGES, MSG_REMOVEOBJECT, MSG_PETHATCHREADYSTATUS, MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS, MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB, MSG_CLIENTZONED

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fixtures: explicit order (_MsgOrder and _MsgType), duplicate tag, lowercase tags (MSG_DailyQuestUpdate), TPYE and TYP typos, untyped GlobalID
- [x] Client-gated: 29 protocols, 1448 records, 1446 ids (corrected from 26/971/969; includes GAME2 55=10, WIZARD2 53=254, WIZARD3 56=213)
- [x] Spot checks: SYSTEM MSG_PING=1; LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3=27; GAME MSG_ATTACH=7, MSG_CLIENTMOVE=36, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE=108, MSG_NEWOBJECT=122, MSG_SERVER_ERROR=223; WIZARD MSG_UPDATEMANA=233; WIZARD2 MSG_CLIENTZONED=64
- [x] Exactly 9 field types; sorting by _MsgName instead of tag fails the GAME test

### Detailed spec from NET-2: Message definition model and ordinal rules

A library turns the client's message XML text into a validated list of protocols, messages and typed fields with correct wire ids.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Messages/MessageDefinition.h/.cpp: ProtocolDef {serviceId, protocolType, version, description, sourceFile}, MessageDef {tag, msgName, handlerName, description, accessLevel, order, fields}, FieldDef {name, DmlType}
- src/server/shared/Messages/MessageDefinitionParser.h/.cpp. It takes XML text. It keys protocols by ServiceID, never by ProtocolType: WizCombatMessages (51) says DOODLEDOUG_MESSAGES, and CatchAKey (54) and ShockALock (44) both say MG3_MESSAGES. It ignores the root element name. The element tag is the identity. It skips '_'-prefixed metadata children. When the first record has _MsgOrder or _MsgType, ids are explicit. Otherwise it sorts by tag using byte-ordinal comparison, merges duplicate tags (GameMessages has MSG_REMOVEOBJECT twice, WizardMessages has MSG_PETHATCHREADYSTATUS twice) and numbers 1..N. It accepts TPYE as TYPE and treats a missing TYPE on a field named GlobalID as GID, each with a warning
- Validation errors: duplicate explicit order, id > 255, unknown type, duplicate ServiceID across files
- XML parser: pugixml from vcpkg (see Dependencies in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- src/test/server/shared/Messages/MessageDefinitionParserTest.cpp with hand-written fixture XML that is Ambrose-authored, not client-extracted
- Client-backed test, skipped unless AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR is set, that loads the real Root.wad through the archive reader

**Client messages:** All 1448 records in the 29 XML files (corrected from 971 in 26). Explicitly exercised: MSG_PING, MSG_PING_RSP, MSG_CUSTOMDICT, MSG_RAW_TEXT, MSG_SERVERMESSAGE, MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, MSG_CHARACTERSELECTED, MSG_LATEST_FILE_LIST_V2, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_BADGES, MSG_REMOVEOBJECT, MSG_SERVER_ERROR, MSG_PETHATCHREADYSTATUS, MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS, MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB

**Data sources**

- Root.wad entries: AISClientMessages.xml, BaseMessages.xml, ExtendedBaseMessages.xml, GameMessages.xml, GameMessages2.xml, LoginMessages.xml, PatchMessages.xml, PetMessages.xml, ScriptDebuggerMessages.xml, TestManagerMessages.xml, WizardMessages.xml, WizardMessages2.xml, WizardMessages3.xml, Messages/{Cantrips,CatchAKey,ChooChooZoo,Concentration,DoodleDoug,Dueling_Diego,HotShots,Housing,MoveBehavior,PhysicsBehavior,PotionMotion,Quest,ShockALock,SkullRiders,Soblocks,WizCombat}Messages.xml
- Some entries may be BINd containers (zlib at offset 13); the archive reader must handle both
- Reference for cross-checking only: a local packet capture (private, never committed)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fixture tests cover: explicit-order file, sorted file with a duplicate tag, lowercase tags (Housing has MSG_DailyQuestUpdate and MSG_DailyPvPUpdate, which sort after all uppercase MSG_D...), the TPYE typo, the TYP typo, and a GlobalID field with no TYPE
- [x] Client-backed test: 29 protocols, 1448 records, 1446 ids (corrected from 26/971/969); per service GAME(5)=253, WIZARD(12)=253, WIZARD2(53)=254, WIZARD3(56)=213, WIZARDHOUSING(50)=212, PET(9)=55, WizCombat(51)=36, LOGIN(7)=29, Soblocks(25)=23, ScriptDebugger(10)=20, QUEST(52)=19, Cantrips(57)=18, GAME2(55)=10, EXTENDEDBASE(2)=6, Physics(16)=6, MoveBehavior(15)=4, PATCH(8)=3, SYSTEM(1)=2, TestManager(11)=2, AIS(19)=1, minigames 40-47 and 54 = 3 each
- [x] Client-backed ordinal spot checks: SYSTEM MSG_PING=1, MSG_PING_RSP=2; EXTENDEDBASE MSG_CUSTOMDICT=1, MSG_CUSTOMRECORD=2, MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT=3, MSG_RAWRECORD=4, MSG_RAW_TEXT=5, MSG_SERVERMESSAGE=6; LOGIN MSG_CHARACTERSELECTED=3, MSG_SELECTCHARACTER=10, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3=27; PATCH MSG_LATEST_FILE_LIST_V2=2; GAME MSG_ATTACH=7, MSG_ATTACHFAILED=8, MSG_BADGES=10, MSG_CLIENTMOVE=36, MSG_LOGINCOMPLETE=108, MSG_NEWOBJECT=122, MSG_REMOVEOBJECT=182, MSG_SERVER_ERROR=223 (tag; its _MsgName is MSG_SERVERERROR); WIZARD MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS=92, MSG_PETHATCHREADYSTATUS=122; Physics MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB=3
- [x] Client-backed type census equals GID 1193, STR 911, UINT 740, INT 530, UBYT 459, FLT 241, BYT 172, WSTR 38, USHRT 27 (4311 fields over the 1446 ids, 4315 over all 1448 records; corrected from 2988), with exactly 3 warnings (TPYE, TYP, untyped GlobalID)
- [x] Sorting by _MsgName instead of tag makes the GAME test fail (191 positions differ), so the test guards the rule

**Risks**

- Needs a KIWAD reader from another domain for the client-backed test
- Whether the real client reads the TPYE field, the TYP field, and the untyped GlobalID field, or drops them, is unknown and changes the wire layout of MSG_PHYSICS_GRAB, MSG_BATTLEGROUNDQUEUEUPDATE, and MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS. The Message definition quirks decision in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md keeps them until capture verification

## 1.15 Runtime message registry and declarations (NET-3)

**Goal:** The user's install loads into a registry, and C++ message declarations resolve against it at startup.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.14

**Client messages:** all 1446 ids

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fixtures: the registry loads definitions and finds messages by (service, order) and by tag, and a failed load or reload keeps the active catalog
- [x] A declaration of a subset of fields encodes to golden bytes, with omitted fields written as their XML default or zero
- [x] Unknown messages, unknown fields, type mismatches, and a field declared twice fail at declaration once definitions are loaded, and fail the load for declarations made earlier; using an undeclared message throws
- [x] Client-gated: the real install loads 1446 ids with 3 warnings, and MSG_PING, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, and MSG_CROWNBALANCE declarations resolve and round-trip
- [x] Nothing is generated at build time, and CI builds and tests without a client

### Detailed spec from NET-3: runtime message registry and startup-validated declarations

Replaces the msggen build-time generator under the 2026-09-13 decision that protocol data loads at runtime. Nothing derived from the client is generated, compiled, or committed.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Messages/MessageRegistry.h/.cpp: `MessageRegistry` with `sMessageRegistry`. `Load(MessageDefinitionSet)`, `LoadFromArchive(path)`, and `LoadFromClient(dir)` (which reads `Data/GameData/Root.wad`) log every warning and error under `server.loading`. Each load builds an immutable `MessageCatalog` snapshot, re-resolves every registered declaration against it, and publishes it atomically only if all of that succeeds; otherwise the active catalog stays live. Readers hold a `MessageCatalogPtr`, so a reload never invalidates a message in use. Declarations made before the first load are resolved by it. `Find(service, order)` is a constant-time 256x256 index, and `Find(service, tag)` looks up by element tag. Each `MessageInfo` holds the protocol, the definition, and each field's default parsed to its DML type
- src/server/shared/Messages/MessageDeclaration.h: a declaration is a struct with `static constexpr uint8 ServiceId`, `static constexpr std::string_view Tag`, and `static constexpr auto Fields()` returning a tuple of `DmlField("XmlName", &Struct::Member)`. Members may be non-const integers matched by size and signedness (so `unsigned long long` binds to GID on every platform), float, double, std::string, std::u16string, bool (UBYT), or an enum with a fixed underlying type. Members may belong to a base class of the declaration
- `MessageRegistry::Declare<Messages...>(errors)` registers each declaration and resolves it to field indices against the loaded catalog. It reports unknown messages, unknown fields, type mismatches, and fields declared twice, so an app can refuse to start. A declaration made before the first load is resolved by that load, and any error fails it. Registry lookups (`Find`, `GetInfo`) return a `MessageInfoPtr` that keeps its catalog alive
- `Encode(message, buffer)` writes every field in the loaded layout order, using the declared member when there is one and the field's default otherwise. It checks string lengths before writing, so an oversized string throws without leaving a partial message in the buffer. `Decode(ByteBuffer&, message)` reads exactly one body and skips undeclared fields. `Decode(span, message)` returns Ok, Truncated, or TrailingBytes, and leaves the message unchanged when truncated
- `Dml::ParseValue(type, text)` parses XML default text. An invalid default is a load warning and uses the zero value
- `MessageDefinitionSet::Add(ProtocolDef)` rejects orders that are zero or do not increase, and repeated tags, so every set the registry loads has unique ids
- src/test/server/shared/Messages/MessageRegistryTest.cpp with Ambrose-authored fixtures, and src/test/client/MessageRegistryClientTest.cpp under the `client` label

**Data sources**

- The user's client install at runtime: `<install>/Data/GameData/Root.wad` message XML

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fixture tests: loading, both lookups, defaults (including an invalid default that warns), a failed reload that keeps the active catalog, a reload that would break a declaration being rejected, readers encoding on other threads during 50 reloads, and loading from an archive and a client folder
- [x] A subset declaration of a fixture message encodes to golden bytes with defaults for omitted fields, and a full declaration covering all 11 DML types round-trips with exact bytes
- [x] Decode skips undeclared variable-length fields, reports Truncated and TrailingBytes, and leaves the message unchanged on truncation
- [x] Declaration errors name the message and field for unknown messages, a wrong service, unknown fields, type mismatches, and duplicates; Encode, Decode, and GetInfo of an undeclared message throw, reloading keeps declarations, and Clear drops them
- [x] Client-gated: 1446 ids and 3 warnings; (5,7) MSG_ATTACH with access level 1, (7,27) MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, (12,92) MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS, (5,254) not found; the four declarations resolve, and their encodings round-trip with the expected sizes

**Risks**

- The XML has no direction attribute, so declarations do not say who sends a message. The dispatch tables in phase 2 curate direction
- Two C++ member types can share a wire type (for example an enum and its underlying integer); declarations check the wire type only, and an enum member accepts any value of its underlying type from the wire

## 1.16 Dynamic messages and round-trip suite (NET-4)

**Goal:** Any (service, order) decodes to named values, and every loaded message provably round-trips.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.15

**Acceptance**

- [x] Round-trip passes for all 1446
- [x] (5,7) is MSG_ATTACH with access 1; (7,27) is MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3; (12,92) is MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS; (5,254) not found
- [x] Truncated body returns false; trailing bytes flagged

### Detailed spec from NET-4: dynamic messages and exhaustive round-trip suite

Any (service, order) pair resolves at runtime to a name, access level, field layout, and a dynamic value holder, and every loaded message provably round-trips. Under the 2026-09-13 runtime decision nothing is generated; the suite is table-driven over the loaded registry.

**Deliverables**

- `MessageInfo` gains `MinSize` (fixed field sizes plus 2 per string), and `MessageCatalog::GetMessages()`, reached through `MessageRegistry::GetCatalog()`, lists every loaded id
- src/server/shared/Messages/DynamicMessage.h/.cpp: pinned to the `MessageCatalogPtr` it was made from, with `Create(catalog, service, order)`, and one `DmlValue` per field, starting from the XML defaults, with `Set` by index or name that checks the type and the 65535 string limit, `Find`, `GetEncodedSize`, `Encode`, `Decode(ByteBuffer&)`, and `Decode(span)` returning Ok, Truncated, or TrailingBytes. `ToString` prints `MSG_TAG (service:order) { Field=value, ... }` for logging unknown or unhandled messages, escaping control bytes and non-ASCII STR bytes as `\xNN`, and capping long strings without splitting a surrogate pair
- src/test/mocks/MessageRoundTrip.h/.cpp: fills any message with deterministic splitmix64 values per type, then checks encoded size, decode equality (bitwise for floats), re-encode equality, the minimum size, truncation by one byte, and a trailing byte
- src/test/server/shared/Messages/DynamicMessageTest.cpp over Ambrose-authored fixtures, and src/test/client/MessageRoundTripClientTest.cpp over every id in the user's install

**Client messages:** all 1446 message ids

**Data sources**

- The registry loaded at runtime from the user's install

**Acceptance**

- [x] The round-trip suite passes for every fixture id with several seeds, and for all 1446 ids of the real install
- [x] Lookups: (5,7) returns MSG_ATTACH with access level 1; (7,27) returns MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3; (12,92) returns MSG_MINIGAMEREWARDS; (5,254) returns not found
- [x] A decode of a truncated body returns false (Truncated) and leaves the values unchanged, and a body with extra trailing bytes is flagged as TrailingBytes rather than silently accepted
- [x] `ToString` names every field, escapes quotes, backslashes, control bytes, and non-ASCII STR bytes, shows GIDs in hex, and caps long STR and WSTR values without splitting a surrogate pair; `Set` rejects strings over the wire limit

**Risks**

- Test runtime over 1446 ids with several properties each; the suite stays in memory and runs in well under a second

## 1.17 KI frame codec and reassembler (NET-5)

**Goal:** 0xF00D frames from fragmented reads.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.06

**Acceptance**

- [x] Control frame with 14-byte body has len 19; DML with 10-byte body has len 19 and dmlLen 14
- [x] One byte at a time yields one frame; 3 frames in one buffer yield 3
- [x] Bad magic or len > MaxFrameSize errors before allocation
- [x] 10k randomized splits clean under ASan/UBSan

### Detailed spec from NET-5: KI frame codec and stream reassembler

Raw TCP bytes are split into complete control frames or DML messages regardless of how reads are fragmented, and outgoing frames are built byte-exactly.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Network/Frame.h/.cpp. FrameHeader: u16 magic 0xF00D (wire 0D F0); u16 len (len counts bytes after itself, including the trailing null); if len==0x8000, a u32 long length follows; then u8 isControl, u8 opcode (control only), u16 reserved. Non-control frames add u8 serviceId, u8 order, u16 dmlLen (= body+4), then the body, then u8 0x00
- src/server/shared/Network/FrameReassembler.h/.cpp: accumulates bytes, yields frames, and enforces `FrameLimits` (max frame size, default 4 MiB; the long-length mode; and the most DML messages one frame may chain, default 1024), which `SetLimits` changes live. The size limit applies to the frame being read, and the long-length mode is fixed for a frame once its prefix has arrived. It sizes each frame from its prefix before buffering it, validates chained DML lengths without allocating, releases buffer memory above 64 KiB once a large frame is consumed, and stops at the first protocol error (bad magic, bad length, an isControl byte other than 0 or 1, too large, a bad DML length, or too many DML messages); it does not resync by skipping bytes
- src/server/shared/Network/FrameWriter.h/.cpp: builds control frames, DML frames with one or more chained messages, and any `Frame` byte-exactly. A body over 0x777F bytes uses the 0x8000 marker. What the u32 counts lives behind `LongFrameLength`: `BodyOnly` (the Imcodec writer, the default) or `HeaderAndBody` (the sniff.py reader). A DML body over 0xFFFB bytes, which cannot fit the 16-bit dmlLen, is rejected
- `FrameLayout` in Frame.h holds the constants, `GetFrameSize` from a prefix, `ValidateDmlPayload`, and `SplitDmlMessages`
- src/test/server/shared/Network/FrameTest.cpp

**Data sources**

- Layout learned from Imcodec.MessageLayer/MessageEncoder.cs and a local packet capture tool/sniff.py Framer (behavior reference only)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Hand-built vectors: a control frame with a 14-byte body has len = 14+5 = 19; a DML frame with a 10-byte body has len = 10+9 = 19 and dmlLen = 14
- [x] Feeding one valid frame one byte at a time yields exactly one frame; feeding 3 frames in one buffer yields 3
- [x] Garbage prefix or wrong magic gives a protocol error; len above Network.MaxFrameSize gives an error before any allocation
- [x] Changing the frame size limit on a running reassembler applies from the next frame, with no reconnect
- [x] A DML frame containing two back-to-back DML messages (dmlLen chaining) decodes into 2 messages (the Imlight decoder supports this; see open question on whether the client sends it)
- [x] Randomized split-point test over 10k generated frames passes under ASan/UBSan

**Risks**

- Long-frame semantics conflict: Imcodec writes the u32 as the message body length with the 0x8000 marker when the body is over 0x777F, while sniff.py computes total = 8 + u32 + 1, which disagrees for DML frames by 8 bytes. Must be confirmed on the wire (NET-6). Both readings are implemented behind `LongFrameLength`, so 1.18 only changes the default

## 1.18 Control messages and capture verification (NET-6)

**Goal:** SessionOffer/KeepAlive/KeepAliveRsp/SessionAccept exact.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.17

**Acceptance**

- [x] Hand-written vectors round-trip
- [ ] Checklist recorded: offer length (23 vs 28 bytes), server keepalive layout, long-frame semantics, multi-DML frames, keepalive cadence

### Detailed spec from NET-6: Control messages and wire capture verification

The four control messages are encoded exactly as the 1.610 client expects, and the open framing questions are settled against real captures.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Network/ControlMessages.h/.cpp, hand-written (they are not in the XML). SessionOffer (opcode 0): u16 sessionId, i32 timeHigh, i32 timeLow, u32 millis, plus whatever trailing bytes the capture proves. KeepAlive (3) client->server: u16 sessionId, u16 millis, u16 elapsedMinutes. Server->client: u16 sessionId, u32 millis. KeepAliveRsp (4): same layout as client KeepAlive. SessionAccept (5): u16 reserved, i32 timeHigh, i32 timeLow, u32 millis, u16 sessionId
- doc/CAPTURE.md: how a maintainer records raw frames from their own client session with their own tooling, the checklist of facts to extract, and the findings so far. Captures themselves are never committed. The checklist adds (f): whether the client accepts TimeHigh as the upper 32 bits of Unix seconds
- Decoders keep unknown trailing SessionOffer and SessionAccept bytes, so a longer offer or accept still decodes; keepalive bodies must be exactly 6 bytes, and the direction picks the opcode 3 layout
- Golden byte-vector tests written by hand from the documented facts (not pasted capture files)

**Client messages:** Control opcodes 0 SessionOffer, 3 KeepAlive, 4 KeepAliveRsp, 5 SessionAccept

**Data sources**

- Behavior reference: Imcodec.MessageLayer/ControlMessageProtocol.cs, Imlight Shared/Services/ControlService.cs, Aurorium src/wizard_patcher.rs (SESSION_OFFER_LENGTH = 28)
- Maintainer's own client capture (local only)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit tests round-trip each control message and match the hand-written vectors
- [ ] Verification checklist answered and recorded in the doc: (a) SessionOffer body length the 1.610 client accepts. Imlight sends a 23-byte frame; the Aurorium patch fetcher expects a 28-byte offer from the live KI patch server. (b) Server keepalive layout and whether the client answers it with opcode 4. (c) Long-frame length semantics for a frame over 0x7780 bytes. (d) Whether the client ever packs 2+ DML messages in one frame. (e) Client KeepAlive cadence
- [ ] FrameWriter long-frame test updated to the confirmed semantics

**Risks**

- The 28-byte offer comes from a newer live server; the 1.610 client may accept either form. If the extra bytes are a signed-key block, a server without KI's key may need to send an empty one

## 1.19 Async socket layer and SocketMgr (NET-7)

**Goal:** Accept many connections and queue frame writes.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.17, 1.11, 1.10

**Acceptance**

- [x] 200 clients x 1000 fragmented frames arrive intact and in order
- [x] Mid-frame close leaks nothing
- [x] DelayedClose flushes before FIN
- [x] A duplicate port bind fails loudly

### Detailed spec from NET-7: Async socket layer and SocketMgr

Each app can listen on its configured port, accept many connections, and read and write frames asynchronously on a network thread pool.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Network/Socket.h/.cpp: a standalone Asio TCP socket with an async read loop into FrameReassembler, a write queue that sends every pending frame as one gathered write, CloseSocket, and DelayedCloseSocket, which drops later frames, flushes the queue, shuts down the send side, and closes on the peer's EOF or after a 5 s linger; a delayed close that cannot drain within 30 s closes anyway. Hooks: OnStart, OnFrame, OnProtocolError, OnClose; SetFrameLimits applies live
- src/server/shared/Network/SocketMgr.h, AsyncAcceptor.h/.cpp, NetworkThread.h: N io threads, each with its own io_context, least-loaded socket placement with each socket accepted straight onto its thread, an accept thread, SO_REUSEADDR off on Windows, TCP_NODELAY on by default. `ApplySettings` rebinds a changed address or port (new listener first, falling back to close-then-bind for the same port, and restoring the old one if that fails), resizes the thread pool (removed threads take no new sockets, a pending accept aimed at one is cancelled and retried on a live thread, and a retired thread exits once it has no connections and no pending accepts), and applies frame limits, OutKBuff, and TCP_NODELAY to the next connection. A same-port rebind closes the old listener synchronously before binding and restores it if the new bind fails. The configured port is compared, so port 0 does not move on reload. Start, stop, and apply are serialized, and a failing accept backs off 100 ms instead of spinning. A thread only drops a closed socket once nothing else holds it
- src/server/shared/Network/NetworkSettings.h/.cpp: loads BindIP, the app's port option, and the Network.* options from config, clamping out-of-range values and reporting each problem
- Config keys in gameserver.conf.dist, documented in doc/config/gameserver.md: BindIP, WorldServerPort, Network.Threads, Network.MaxFrameSize, Network.MaxDmlMessages, Network.LongFrameLength, Network.OutKBuff, Network.TcpNoDelay. The loginserver and patchserver files gain the same keys with their own port options in 1.20
- src/test/server/shared/Network/SocketIntegrationTest.cpp with a loopback fake client

**Data sources**

- None

**Acceptance**

- [x] Loopback test: 200 concurrent fake clients each send 1000 fragmented frames; every frame arrives intact and in order per connection
- [x] A peer closing mid-frame releases the socket with no leak (ASan/LSan clean)
- [x] DelayedClose sends the final queued frame before FIN (needed for MSG_CHARACTERSELECTED and MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT)
- [x] Starting two apps on the same port fails loudly with a logged bind error
- [x] Reloading config applies Network.MaxFrameSize, Network.OutKBuff, and Network.TcpNoDelay from the next connection, resizes the pool for a changed Network.Threads, and rebinds a changed Port without dropping existing sessions; a failed bind keeps the old listener and logs why

**Risks**

- Standalone Asio was chosen (doc/ARCHITECTURE.md Decisions, Stack)
- Imlight treats each recv() as a full packet (SocketListener.ProcessReceivedData), which breaks under fragmentation. Do not copy that behavior

## 1.20 App skeletons (FND-12)

**Goal:** loginserver, gameserver, patchserver lifecycle.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.10, 1.11

**Acceptance**

- [x] --version exits 0
- [x] Missing conf names the path and exits 1
- [x] Ctrl+C exits 0 within 2 s

### Detailed spec from FND-12: App skeletons: loginserver, gameserver, patchserver start and stop cleanly

All three executables run the standard lifecycle (args, config, logging, banner, io loop, signal shutdown), ready for NET and database to plug in.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/App/ServerApp.h/.cpp: the shared lifecycle (options, config, logging, banner, shutdown signals, optional update tick, exit codes) with OnStart, OnUpdate, GetUpdateInterval, and OnStop hooks, and src/server/shared/App/AppOptions.h/.cpp
- src/server/apps/{loginserver,gameserver,patchserver}/Main.cpp + CMakeLists.txt, linking shared
- src/server/apps/<app>/<app>.conf.dist listing every option the skeleton reads (LogsDir, Log.*, Console.Colors, Appender.*, Logger.*, BindIP, the port option, Network.*, and World.UpdateInterval for gameserver), documented in doc/config/<app>.md. Default ports: LoginServerPort 12000, WorldServerPort 12333, PatchServerPort 12500
- Command-line, parsed by hand: -c/--config <file>, --set Key=Value (repeatable, the command-line override layer), -v/--version, -h/--help
- SIGINT/SIGTERM and Windows console Ctrl+C handler trigger graceful stop; process exit code 0
- Main loop tick with configurable update diff for gameserver (World update placeholder for WLD); World.UpdateInterval is read every tick, so a reload applies from the next tick
- src/test/server/shared/App/ServerAppTest.cpp (in process, including a real SIGINT) and src/test/apps/AppSmokeTest.cmake, which runs each built executable for --version and a missing config
- Optional Windows service and daemon hooks are planned for 17.08, where the Ambrose supervisor can itself run under systemd or as a Windows service (see Operations in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Acceptance**

- [x] `gameserver --version` prints GitRevision full version and exits 0
- [x] Starting gameserver without gameserver.conf logs a clear error naming the expected path and exits 1; with a copied .conf.dist it logs the banner and 'ready'
- [x] Ctrl+C logs 'shutting down' and exits 0 within 2 seconds on Windows and Linux
- [x] Real client: nothing yet. Launching the client with `-L 127.0.0.1 <LoginServerPort>` still gives a connection failure because no socket is bound. The first client-visible step (sending the SessionOffer on accept) is NET-1.

**Risks**

- Default ports follow the conventional 12000/12333/12500 split; every port changes live through config

## 1.21 Patch-free dev path documented (PAT-1)

**Goal:** Run the client without KingsIsle patch hosts.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.19

**Acceptance**

- [ ] With -P 0 a listener on :12500 records zero connections while the client connects to :12000
- [ ] The default behaviour without -P is recorded in doc/PATCHING.md
- [ ] No 'Patch failed' dialog with -P 0

### Detailed spec from PAT-1: Patch-free development path (client -P 0) proven and documented

Every other domain can run the retail client against loginserver/gameserver with no patchserver and no contact with KingsIsle patch hosts.

**Deliverables**

- doc/PATCHING.md: how to launch WizardGraphicalClient.exe with -L <host> <port> -P 0 (and optional -A <locale>) from the user's own install; warning never to run the retail launcher against a pinned install
- apps/launcher/ (repo tooling): run-client.ps1 and run-client.bat reading the install path from conf/launcher.conf (git-ignored), copied from conf/dist/launcher.conf.dist. Replaced in milestone 3.25 by the `launcher` program in src/tools/launcher, and removed with it Replaced in 3.25 by the `launcher` program, which starts the client from a run folder of its own.
- gameserver.conf.dist + loginserver.conf.dist option Patch.Enabled = 0 (default for dev), consumed by 16.07 (PAT-9) and applied live from the next login or zone transfer

**Data sources**

- Bin/WizardGraphicalClient.exe usage string: '-P <Patching Enabled (0|1)>', '-PT - <Patch Client Patch Time>', '-A <locale>', '-L <login server name | IP> <Port>'
- Bin/PatchConfig.xml in the user's install (PatchServerHostname/PatchServerPort/LoginHostname/CommandLine)

**Acceptance**

- [ ] With a plain TCP listener bound to 127.0.0.1:12500 and the client launched with -L 127.0.0.1 12000 -P 0, the listener records zero connections while the client connects to port 12000 (any login-port listener, no loginserver needed)
- [ ] Repeat without -P: record whether the client contacts the PatchConfig.xml host (patch.us.wizard101.com:12500) by default; result written into doc/PATCHING.md (resolves the default-value open question)
- [ ] Client shows the login screen with no 'Patch failed - Error connecting Patch Server' or GUI_PatchingFailed dialog when -P 0 is used

**Risks**

- Unverified: the default value of PatchingEnabled when -P is omitted; a launch without -P may reach out to KingsIsle
- With patching disabled the client may refuse zones whose WADs are missing locally (the MSG_PATCHINGBLOCKED path), so dev installs must be complete

## 1.22 Session handshake and keep-alive (NET-8)

**Goal:** A real client completes the handshake with loginserver.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.18, 1.19, 1.20, 1.16, 1.21

**Client messages:** MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fake client: wrong accept id closes; no accept in 15 s closes; keepalive echo correct
- [x] Real client: log shows SessionOffer sent, SessionAccept with matching id, then 'LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (7:27)' (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client through apps/launcher: Login.log shows 'Session 3 offered to 172.31.64.1:59427', 'Session 3 accepted by 172.31.64.1:59427 after 17 ms' and 'LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (7:27) from session 3, 264 bytes'; that run also showed the client ends its KeepAlive frames without the trailing byte, which ControlMessages now reads)
- [ ] Idle 5 minutes at login: keepalives both ways, no drop

### Detailed spec from NET-8: Session object, handshake and keep-alive

A real Wizard101 client completes the session handshake with an Ambrose server and stays connected while idle.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Network/SessionBase.h/.cpp: unique u16 session id allocator (never 0, recycled only after close), offer timestamp/millis stored and exposed (LOG needs them for MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 decryption), and states Offered -> Accepted -> (app-defined)
- Sends SessionOffer immediately on accept, ahead of any other work. Waits for SessionAccept with Network.SessionAcceptTimeout (default 15s); a mismatched sessionId gives a protocol error and close
- Answers client KeepAlive with KeepAliveRsp echoing the elapsed field. Optional server keepalive every Network.KeepAliveInterval (60s) with Network.KeepAliveTimeout (15s). All three timeouts apply from the next timer after a config reload
- DML frames received before SessionAccept are queued, not dropped (Imlight SessionActor._preInitMessages suggests the client can send early)
- Round-trip time measured from offer to accept and from keepalive exchanges
- src/server/apps/loginserver: a minimal bootstrap that runs only the handshake and logs every decoded DML message by name via MessageRegistry

**Client messages:** Control 0/3/4/5, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (logged only, handled by LOG)

**Data sources**

- User's 1.610 client executable (run locally by the maintainer)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit test with a fake client: offer bytes as specified; accept with the wrong id closes; no accept in 15s closes; keepalive echo is correct
- [x] Real client: start loginserver, launch the client pointed at 127.0.0.1:12000 (-L 127.0.0.1 12000), and trigger login. The server log shows SessionOffer sent, SessionAccept received with a matching id, then a decoded 'LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (7:27)' line proving the client accepted the session and moved on to authenticate (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client through apps/launcher: Login.log shows 'Session 3 offered to 172.31.64.1:59427', 'Session 3 accepted by 172.31.64.1:59427 after 17 ms' and 'LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (7:27) from session 3, 264 bytes'; that run also showed the client ends its KeepAlive frames without the trailing byte, which ControlMessages now reads)
- [ ] Real client idle for 5 minutes at the login stage: keepalives are logged in both directions and the server never drops the session

**Risks**

- Exactly when the client opens the login connection (at launch or on pressing Login) is unverified
- Imlight suspends heartbeat timeouts during the login-to-game handoff (MSG_OPCODE_HALT in ControlService.cs); a too-strict timeout may drop clients during character select
