<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: Roadmap phase 2, Log in to character select. -->

# Phase 2: Log in to character select

**Done when:** The correct password lands on an empty character select screen. A wrong password shows the client's invalid-login dialog and allows a retry.

## Review notes for this phase

The roadmap critic flagged these. Resolve each one before or while implementing the milestones it names.

- **Ordering.** 2.13 acceptance runs a console `account create test test` in loginserver, but the command/console framework (CommandMgr, 4.02) comes later and itself depends on 2.13. Either add a minimal console to 2.13 or 1.20, or move account creation after 4.02. Resolved in 2.13: every app has a console command table and reader, and 4.02 takes it over.

## 2.01 MySQLConnection and raw queries (FND-13)

**Goal:** Open a connection and read typed fields.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.10

**Acceptance**

- [x] Field '255' as TINYINT UNSIGNED gives Get<uint8>()==255
- [x] With AMBROSE_TEST_DB: SELECT 1; KILL CONNECTION_ID() then reconnect succeeds

### Detailed spec from FND-13: database: MySQL connector dependency and MySQLConnection with raw queries

The database layer can open a connection, run a query, and read typed fields.

**Deliverables**

- Decision point, settled in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md: MariaDB Connector/C from vcpkg (`libmariadb`, found with `find_package(unofficial-libmariadb)`), working with both MySQL 8 and MariaDB servers
- src/server/database/Database/MySQLConnection.h/.cpp: connection info from the string 'host;port;user;password;database' (AzerothCore convention, e.g. LoginDatabaseInfo), Open/Close, Execute(sql), Query(sql) -> QueryResult, escape, automatic reconnect on CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR/CR_SERVER_LOST with backoff, SSL option
- src/server/database/Database/QueryResult.h/.cpp, Field.h/.cpp: typed getters Get<uint8..uint64,int*,float,double,std::string,std::vector<uint8>>, IsNull, with type-mismatch assertion logged to sql.sql
- src/server/database/Database/DatabaseEnvFwd.h
- database library target linking shared (empty for now) + common
- src/test/server/database/FieldTest.cpp (no server needed); DB integration tests gated by AMBROSE_TEST_DB connection string, GTEST_SKIP otherwise

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: Field built from the string '255' as TINYINT UNSIGNED gives Get<uint8>()==255; NULL field IsNull()
- [x] Integration (with AMBROSE_TEST_DB): SELECT 1 returns one row, one field == 1
- [x] Integration: killing the connection server-side (KILL CONNECTION_ID()) followed by a query reconnects and succeeds
- [x] Wrong password logs a sql.sql error with the MySQL error code and Open() returns the error
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Connector licensing (GPL libmysqlclient vs LGPL MariaDB C) for a private repo that may go public
- Windows install of the connector for contributors and CI

## 2.02 Prepared statements (FND-14)

**Goal:** Typed binding per database.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.01

**Acceptance**

- [x] SELECT ? + ? with 3, 4 returns 7
- [x] Blob with NUL round-trips
- [x] A bad statement fails PrepareStatements() with 'Could not prepare statement <NAME>'; 2.04 turns that into a startup stop

### Detailed spec from FND-14: database: prepared statements with typed binding

All SQL runs through registered, typed prepared statements per database.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/database/Database/PreparedStatement.h/.cpp: PreparedStatementBase with SetData(index, value) for bool/uint8..uint64/int8..int64/float/double/string/std::vector<uint8>/std::nullptr_t, template PreparedStatement<ConnectionType>
- MySQLPreparedStatement.h/.cpp: binds MYSQL_BIND, checks the parameter count against the placeholder count, stores the query text for logging
- PreparedQueryResult (binary protocol rows) with the same Field API
- Implementation/LoginDatabase.h/.cpp, CharacterDatabase.h/.cpp, WorldDatabase.h/.cpp: statement enums (a SERVER_TIME placeholder each, which needs no schema) and DoPrepareStatements() with PrepareStatement(id, name, sql, ConnectionFlags::Sync|Async|Both)
- Fail-fast: any statement that fails to prepare aborts pool open with the id and SQL logged

**Acceptance**

- [x] Integration: a prepared SELECT ? + ? with uint32 3 and 4 returns 7
- [x] Binding a string with embedded NUL and a 1 MB blob round-trips byte-exactly
- [x] Leaving a parameter unset makes Execute fail with a logged 'parameter N not bound' (in every build, never an assert, so a running server does not abort)
- [x] A syntax error in a registered statement makes PrepareStatements() fail and log 'Could not prepare statement <NAME>' with the SQL; the loader in 2.04 turns that failure into a startup stop
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- MYSQL_TYPE and bool handling differ between MySQL 8 and MariaDB connectors (my_bool removal)

## 2.03 DatabaseWorkerPool (FND-15)

**Goal:** Sync and async pools.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.02, 1.11

**Acceptance**

- [x] 1000 AsyncQuery from 8 threads complete
- [x] No concurrent use of one connection
- [x] Close drains deterministically under ASan

### Detailed spec from FND-15: database: DatabaseWorkerPool with sync and async connections

Game code can run blocking queries on a small connection pool and queue async queries served by worker threads.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/database/Database/DatabaseWorkerPool.h/.cpp: Open(info, asyncThreads, syncThreads), Close, Execute/DirectExecute, Query/Query(stmt), AsyncQuery returning QueryCallback, KeepAlive ping timer
- DatabaseWorker.h/.cpp: thread draining a ProducerConsumerQueue<SQLOperation*>
- SQLOperation.h, AdhocStatement.h/.cpp, QueryHolder.h/.cpp (batch of prepared queries loaded async, used later for character login)
- DatabaseEnv.h/.cpp: extern LoginDatabase, CharacterDatabase, WorldDatabase
- MySQL server and client version checks at open (min version constant)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Integration: 1000 AsyncQuery calls from 8 threads all complete, with results matching inputs
- [x] Sync Query on a pool of 2 connections from 4 threads blocks correctly and never uses a connection concurrently (checked by each connection's concurrent-use counter, with CONNECTION_ID() showing both connections served)
- [x] Close() while async work is queued drains or cancels deterministically, with no leak under ASan
- [x] KeepAlive keeps a connection past wait_timeout=5 set in the test session
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- Callback delivery threading: callbacks must run on the owning app's update thread, not DB workers (see FND-16)

## 2.04 Transactions, QueryCallback, DatabaseLoader (FND-16)

**Goal:** Atomic writes and callbacks on the update thread.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.03

**Acceptance**

- [x] A unique-key violation rolls back to 0 rows
- [x] Deadlock loser retries
- [x] loginserver logs 'Opened database connection pool login: 1 async, 1 sync'

### Detailed spec from FND-16: database: transactions, QueryCallback chaining, DatabaseLoader

Multi-statement atomic writes and main-thread callback processing work, and apps open all their pools through one loader.

**Deliverables**

- Transaction.h/.cpp: Append(stmt or adhoc), CommitTransaction (async), DirectCommitTransaction, retry on deadlock (ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK) up to a time limit, TransactionCallback
- QueryCallback.h/.cpp with WithCallback/WithPreparedCallback and chaining; AsyncCallbackProcessor.h (QueryCallbackProcessor, TransactionCallbackProcessor, QueryHolderCallbackProcessor) pumped from the app update loop
- src/server/database/Database/DatabaseLoader.h/.cpp: AddDatabase(pool, name) that queues open, prepare, and later the updater; Load() runs them in order and unwinds on failure
- Config options per app .conf.dist: LoginDatabaseInfo, CharacterDatabaseInfo, WorldDatabaseInfo, *.WorkerThreads, *.SynchThreads, MaxPingTime. They apply live on a config reload (through 4.15 when it lands): a changed connection string opens and validates a new pool, then swaps it in and drains the old one, and a failure keeps the old pool and logs the error; thread counts resize live; MaxPingTime applies from the next ping

**Acceptance**

- [x] Integration: a transaction inserting 2 rows where the second violates a unique key leaves 0 rows
- [x] Forced deadlock between two transactions: the loser retries and both finally commit
- [x] A QueryCallback chain (query A then B using A's result) runs both callbacks on the processor thread (checked by thread id)
- [x] loginserver with a bad LoginDatabaseInfo exits 1 with a clear error; with a valid one logs 'Opened database connection pool login: 1 async, 1 sync' (both run against the real binary in AppSmoke.loginserver, the second when AMBROSE_TEST_DB is set)
- [x] A syntax error in a registered statement makes DatabaseLoader::Load() fail with 'Could not prepare statement LOGIN_...' and close every pool it opened, which stops loginserver startup with exit code 1
- [x] Integration: changing LoginDatabaseInfo and reloading config swaps to the new pool without dropping queued queries; an unreachable string keeps the old pool and logs the error (tested through ConfigMgr::Reload and DatabaseLoader::ApplyConfig, which the reload triggers of 4.15 call on a running loginserver)
- [x] Real client: n/a

## 2.05 Updater: AutoSetup and base populate (FND-17 part 1)

**Goal:** Create empty DBs and import base/.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.04, 1.12

**Acceptance**

- [x] A fresh server gets the login DB created with base imported and updates/updates_include tables

### Detailed spec from FND-17: database/Updater part 1: base import and in-order update application

An empty database is created from base/ and then brought current by applying dated update files exactly once, recorded in `updates`.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/base/db_{login,characters,world}/updates.sql and updates_include.sql: tables `updates` (name PK, hash CHAR(64) SHA-256 hex, state ENUM('RELEASED','CUSTOM','MODULE','ARCHIVED','PENDING'), timestamp, speed) and `updates_include` (path, state) seeded with $/data/sql/updates/db_<name> RELEASED and $/data/sql/custom/db_<name> CUSTOM
- src/server/database/Updater/DBUpdater.h/.cpp: Create database (if Updates.AutoSetup), Populate from base/ when the schema has no tables, Update(): read includes, list *.sql, validate names YYYY_MM_DD_NN.sql for RELEASED (any name for CUSTOM), sort, apply unapplied ones, record hash/state/speed
- UpdateFetcher.h/.cpp: file discovery and hashing (SHA-256 of file bytes with line endings normalized to LF)
- SQL file execution: multi-statement execution via CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS on a dedicated connection (settled in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md), with a quote- and comment-aware splitter that names the failing statement and its line and refuses DELIMITER, stopping on the first error
- Config: Updates.EnableDatabases (bitmask login=1, characters=2, world=4), Updates.AutoSetup, Updates.SourcePath
- `db update` on a running server applies pending data-only update files live, then reloads the stores they touch. By default a file with schema statements is refused, since schema updates the running binary needs are a documented restart case; an opt-in experimental setting, off by default, applies such a file live instead, at the operator's risk that the running binary fails against a schema it does not expect. Deferred to 4.15, which adds the command and reload framework; until then updates run at startup only

**Acceptance**

- [x] Integration: on a fresh server, loginserver startup creates the login DB, imports base, applies data/sql/updates/db_login/2026_01_01_00.sql, and a second start applies nothing ('database is up to date'); AppSmoke.loginserver runs both starts against the real binary when AMBROSE_TEST_DB is set
- [x] A test update with a syntax error stops startup, names the file and error, and records no row for it
- [x] Files are applied in name order even when created out of order on disk
- [x] A CUSTOM file in custom/db_login is applied with state CUSTOM
- [x] A badly named file in updates/ (e.g. 2026-1-1.sql) is refused with an error
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS error handling mid-file is tricky (must drain all result sets); the CLI route needs mysql on PATH
- A DELIMITER statement for stored procedures only works with the CLI

## 2.06 Updater: dated update application (FND-17 part 2)

**Goal:** Apply YYYY_MM_DD_NN.sql once, in order.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.05

**Acceptance**

- [x] Second start logs 'database is up to date'
- [x] A syntax error names the file and records no row
- [x] Name order is respected; a CUSTOM file gets state CUSTOM; 2026-1-1.sql is refused

### Detailed spec from FND-17: database/Updater part 1: base import and in-order update application

An empty database is created from base/ and then brought current by applying dated update files exactly once, recorded in `updates`.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/base/db_{login,characters,world}/updates.sql and updates_include.sql: tables `updates` (name PK, hash CHAR(64) SHA-256 hex, state ENUM('RELEASED','CUSTOM','MODULE','ARCHIVED','PENDING'), timestamp, speed) and `updates_include` (path, state) seeded with $/data/sql/updates/db_<name> RELEASED and $/data/sql/custom/db_<name> CUSTOM
- src/server/database/Updater/DBUpdater.h/.cpp: Create database (if Updates.AutoSetup), Populate from base/ when the schema has no tables, Update(): read includes, list *.sql, validate names YYYY_MM_DD_NN.sql for RELEASED (any name for CUSTOM), sort, apply unapplied ones, record hash/state/speed
- UpdateFetcher.h/.cpp: file discovery and hashing (SHA-256 of file bytes with line endings normalized to LF)
- SQL file execution: multi-statement execution via CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS on a dedicated connection (settled in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md), with a quote- and comment-aware splitter that names the failing statement and its line and refuses DELIMITER, stopping on the first error
- Config: Updates.EnableDatabases (bitmask login=1, characters=2, world=4), Updates.AutoSetup, Updates.SourcePath
- `db update` on a running server applies pending data-only update files live, then reloads the stores they touch. By default a file with schema statements is refused, since schema updates the running binary needs are a documented restart case; an opt-in experimental setting, off by default, applies such a file live instead, at the operator's risk that the running binary fails against a schema it does not expect. Deferred to 4.15, which adds the command and reload framework; until then updates run at startup only

**Acceptance**

- [x] Integration: on a fresh server, loginserver startup creates the login DB, imports base, applies data/sql/updates/db_login/2026_01_01_00.sql, and a second start applies nothing ('database is up to date'); AppSmoke.loginserver runs both starts against the real binary when AMBROSE_TEST_DB is set
- [x] A test update with a syntax error stops startup, names the file and error, and records no row for it
- [x] Files are applied in name order even when created out of order on disk
- [x] A CUSTOM file in custom/db_login is applied with state CUSTOM
- [x] A badly named file in updates/ (e.g. 2026-1-1.sql) is refused with an error
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS error handling mid-file is tricky (must drain all result sets); the CLI route needs mysql on PATH
- A DELIMITER statement for stored procedures only works with the CLI

## 2.07 dbimport (FND-20)

**Goal:** Create and update all 3 DBs without a server.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 2.06

**Acceptance**

- [x] Creates ambrose_login/characters/world, exits 0; rerun says up to date
- [x] A broken update exits 1 and names the file

### Detailed spec from FND-20: src/tools/dbimport

A standalone tool creates and updates all three databases without starting any server, for installs and CI.

**Deliverables**

- src/tools/dbimport/Main.cpp + CMakeLists.txt + dbimport.conf.dist (LoginDatabaseInfo, CharacterDatabaseInfo, WorldDatabaseInfo, Updates.*, Appender/Logger)
- Runs DatabaseLoader with open, AutoSetup, populate and update for each enabled DB, then exits: 0 on success, 1 on any failure
- CI job switched to dbimport for SQL validation: the DbImport CTest runs dbimport against the Linux legs' MySQL 8 and validates every repository SQL file on each Linux CI leg run (on every push until 2026-09-16)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Against an empty server, `dbimport` creates ambrose_login, ambrose_characters and ambrose_world, applies base and updates, exits 0; a second run logs up to date for all three
- [x] A broken update exits 1 and names the file
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- ARCHITECTURE.md says tools depend only on shared and common, but dbimport must link the database layer. Settled on 2026-09-13: tools may depend on database, shared and common (see Layering in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 2.08 Pools wired into apps, DB appender (FND-21)

**Goal:** Apps open DBs and run the updater.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 1.20, 2.07

**Acceptance**

- [x] gameserver on an empty DB logs updater output for 3 DBs then 'ready'
- [x] Appender.DB writes login.logs
- [x] DB outage logs reconnect attempts

### Detailed spec from FND-21: database/Logging: DB appender, and wiring pools into the app skeletons

Apps open their databases and run the updater at startup, and log lines can be stored in the database.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/database/Logging/AppenderDB.h/.cpp: appender type 'DB' inserting into login.`logs` (time, realm id, type, level, text) through an async prepared statement, only enabled after pools open
- data/sql/updates/db_login/<date>_NN.sql creating `logs`
- loginserver opens LoginDatabase; gameserver opens Login, Character and World; patchserver opens none until 16.04 settles what it stores. Each runs DBUpdater first when Updates.EnableDatabases allows
- Graceful shutdown closes pools after the io loop stops

**Acceptance**

- [x] gameserver startup on an empty DB server logs updater output for all three databases, then 'ready' (AppSmoke.gameserver against the real binary when AMBROSE_TEST_DB is set)
- [x] With `Appender.DB = 4,2,0` and `Logger.server.gameserver = 2,Console DB`, startup INFO lines appear in login.logs (AppenderDBTest, and checked by hand on gameserver against MySQL 8.0.46 on 2026-09-14: the banner and 'gameserver ready' lines were in login.logs)
- [x] Stopping the DB server during run logs reconnect attempts rather than crashing (checked by hand on 2026-09-14: MySQL 8.0.46 was stopped under a running gameserver, which logged reconnect attempts, stayed up, and reconnected all six connections within 2 seconds of the server's return)
- [x] Real client: n/a

**Risks**

- The DB appender must not recurse when SQL errors are themselves logged (sql.* must not route to the DB appender)

## 2.09 Dispatch table, session states, LOGIN table (NET-9 + LOG-1)

**Goal:** Route each message to one handler in the required state.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.22, 1.16

**Client messages:** MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_PING

**Acceptance**

- [x] Wrong state is dropped with 'received <NAME> in state X' (MessageHandlerTableTest, and LoginSessionTest over a real socket)
- [x] STATUS_NEVER strikes; MaxStrikes disconnects (refused and foreign-service messages strike; LoginSessionTest closes a session at Network.MaxStrikes)
- [x] LOGIN table has 29 entries matching _MsgOrder (LoginMessageTableClientTest against the r806919 install: 1 handled, 15 not handled yet, 13 refused)
- [x] Coverage check fails the build on a missing id (adapted: ids load at runtime, so the check runs at startup and stops the login server, and the client test runs it against the install)
- [x] Real client: MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 reaches LoginSession::HandleUserAuthenV3 (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client: 'LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (7:27) from session 4' was handled by LoginSession, which logged 'authenticated as <account> (id 1)')

### Detailed spec from NET-9: Message dispatch table and session states

Each incoming DML message is routed to exactly one Session::Handle<Message> member, only when the session is in the required state and on the correct thread.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Messages/MessageHandlerTable.h: template MessageHandlerTable<SessionT> indexed [service][order] -> {status: STATUS_NEVER|STATUS_CONNECTED|STATUS_AUTHED|STATUS_LOGGEDIN|STATUS_INWORLD, mode: PROCESS_INPLACE|PROCESS_THREADUNSAFE|PROCESS_ZONE, handler: void (SessionT::*)(Msg&)}. It is built from DEFINE_HANDLER(Msg, status, mode, &SessionT::HandleX) so the generated struct type supplies (service, order)
- src/server/game/Server/GameSession.h/.cpp with src/server/game/Server/Protocol/GameMessageTable.cpp. src/server/apps/loginserver/Server/LoginSession.h/.cpp with LoginMessageTable.cpp. src/server/apps/patchserver/Server/PatchSession.* with PatchMessageTable.cpp. Built in 2.09: the shared MessageHandlerTable and the login table; the game table arrives with GameSession in 4.01 and the patch table with the TCP service in 16.04
- Every client->server message not yet implemented is registered STATUS_NEVER with HandleNULL, so unimplemented is explicit. Server->client-only messages are marked STATUS_NEVER with HandleServerSide. Adapted in 2.09 after AzerothCore's STATUS_UNHANDLED: messages not handled yet are listed with the statuses they will need and are dropped without a strike, so a real client is not disconnected for traffic Ambrose has not implemented; only server-only messages are refused with a strike
- Inbound queue: PROCESS_INPLACE runs on the network thread; others are queued and drained in Session::Update(diff) (world tick) or by the zone that owns the player
- Handler grouping per doc: src/server/game/Handlers/<Subsystem>Handler.cpp (empty stubs created only when a subsystem lands)
- Network.MaxStrikes is a live setting read at each strike, so a change applies to the next strike (registered with 4.16 when it lands)
- src/test/server/game/Server/MessageTableTest.cpp

**Client messages:** MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK, MSG_ATTACH, MSG_PING

**Data sources**

- Generated registry (NET-4)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Test: a message in the wrong state is dropped with a logged 'received <NAME> in state X', and the handler is not called
- [x] Test: a STATUS_NEVER message increments a strike counter; Network.MaxStrikes (default 10) disconnects
- [x] Test: a body that fails Decode is dropped, logged with the service/order name, and counts a strike
- [x] Test: every (service, order) in MessageRegistry has an entry in each app's table, so a coverage check fails the build if an id is missing (adapted as above: at startup the table must hold exactly one rule for every message of the login server's own services, SYSTEM, EXTENDEDBASE and LOGIN, or the server stops; every other service is refused; the client test checks all 37 rules against the install)
- [x] Real client: LOGIN MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 reaches LoginSession::HandleUserAuthenV3 (a stub that logs); a crafted GAME MSG_ATTACH (5:7) from a test client to loginserver is rejected by state (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client: handled by LoginSession, which logged 'authenticated as <account> (id 1)'; the crafted GAME MSG_ATTACH is refused in LoginSessionTest)

**Risks**

- The XML has no direction attribute, so the client->server / server->client split must be curated by hand per message, over 969 ids
- _MsgAccessLvl (present on only 14 messages, e.g. MSG_ATTACH=1, MSG_USER_AUTHEN*=1) is not proven to mean the same as session state; treat it as a hint only

### Detailed spec from LOG-1: loginserver app skeleton, session accept and LOGIN dispatch table

A real client started with -L 127.0.0.1 12000 connects to our loginserver, completes the session handshake, stays connected, and every LOGIN (service 7) message it sends reaches a named handler slot.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/apps/loginserver/Main.cpp: loads loginserver.conf, opens the login and characters DB pools, runs the acceptor and signal handling
- src/server/apps/loginserver/Server/LoginSocket.{h,cpp}: per-connection session built on the NET session (SessionOffer, SessionAccept, KeepAlive, KeepAliveRsp) that remembers SessionID, offer seconds and offer milliseconds for the crypto in LOG-3
- src/server/apps/loginserver/Server/LoginOpcodes.{h,cpp}: dispatch table of all 29 LOGIN messages by _MsgOrder (the ids come straight from LoginMessages.xml), each tagged with required state (Never / Authenticated / CharacterSelected) and a Handle<Message> member; unimplemented entries are logged and dropped, never fatal
- conf/dist/loginserver.conf.dist: BindIP, LoginServerPort=12000, LoginDatabaseInfo, CharacterDatabaseInfo, KeepAliveInterval, SessionAcceptTimeout, MaxConnections. BindIP and LoginServerPort rebind live, opening the new listener before closing the old one, and a failed bind keeps the old listener; MaxConnections, KeepAliveInterval and SessionAcceptTimeout apply from the next connection or timer; the database strings follow 2.04
- src/test/server/apps/loginserver/LoginOpcodesTest.cpp

**Client messages:** MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3

**Data sources**

- Root.wad LoginMessages.xml (service 7, 29 messages with explicit _MsgOrder)
- Root.wad BaseMessages.xml, ExtendedBaseMessages.xml

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: the dispatch table holds exactly 29 entries whose ids match _MsgOrder 1..29 and whose names match LoginMessages.xml (the test reads the XML from the user's install via the DAT WAD reader and skips when no install is configured)
- [x] Unit: a message received in the wrong state (for example MSG_REQUESTCHARACTERLIST before authentication) is dropped and logged, and the session stays open
- [x] Real client: WizardGraphicalClient.exe -L 127.0.0.1 12000 connects; the server log shows SessionOffer sent and SessionAccept received with a matching SessionID; the connection survives at least 2 minutes of keepalives; the client shows its login UI (no -U) or sits waiting for authentication, with no crash and no disconnect dialog (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client after the KeepAlive frame fix: session 4 stayed open from 11:27:43 to 11:30:28 with KeepAlive and KeepAliveRsp logged in both directions, through the login UI and character select, with no crash or disconnect dialog)
- [ ] Real client: MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 (order 27) arrives, is decoded field by field (Version=W.1.610.x, Revision=r806919.Wizard_1_610, Locale, MachineID) and logged

**Risks**

- The session-offer fields for the packet encryption added in 2021 are not understood; the reference server gets by without them (Imlight docs kinp/controlmessages.md). If a newer revision requires them, login is blocked until NET reverse-engineers them.
- Service 2 (EXTENDEDBASE) has no _MsgOrder, so its ids come from sorting names; MSG_SERVERMESSAGE was observed as order 6. NET must own that rule.

## 2.10 Outbound send API and base messages (NET-10)

**Goal:** SendMessage, ping reply, server message, kick.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 2.09

**Client messages:** MSG_PING, MSG_PING_RSP, MSG_SERVERMESSAGE, MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT, MSG_RAW_TEXT, MSG_CUSTOMDICT, MSG_CUSTOMRECORD, MSG_RAWRECORD

**Acceptance**

- [x] MSG_SERVERMESSAGE frame is service 2 order 6 with a correct WSTR (OutboundMessagesTest over loopback; the client test confirms order 6 and the encoding against the r806919 install)
- [x] KickPlayer keeps the socket open until MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT flushes (OutboundMessagesTest backs up over a megabyte of server messages behind small socket buffers, kicks, and reads every one of them and then MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT before the connection closes)

### Detailed spec from NET-10: Outbound send API and base-service messages

Game code sends any generated message with one call, and the server can show a message to or kick a client.

**Deliverables**

- SessionBase::SendMessage<T>(T const&): encode into a pooled buffer, frame, and queue. SendMessageDelayedClose<T> for final messages. Built as SendDmlMessage and SendDmlMessageDelayedClose, because Windows headers define SendMessage as a macro. Each message is encoded straight into its frame, which moves into the send queue, so no pooled buffer or copy is needed; sends to a closed or closing session return false, and each connection's send queue is capped by Network.MaxSendQueueBytes
- src/server/shared/Network/SystemMessages.cpp: MSG_PING handled inplace by replying MSG_PING_RSP. Built as SessionBase::HandlePing, registered for every app by SystemMessageRules.h, and limited by Network.PingBurst and Network.PingsPerSecond so a ping flood strikes instead of queueing replies
- Helpers: Session::SendServerMessage(std::u16string const&, bool modal) via EXTENDEDBASE MSG_SERVERMESSAGE (2:6, Modal UBYT, Message WSTR). Session::KickPlayer(uint32 type, std::string reason) via MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT (2:3, Type UINT, TimeStamp STR, Message STR) then DelayedClose. The reason is cut to 1024 bytes at a character boundary, and the session closes even when the message cannot be sent
- MSG_RAW_TEXT, MSG_CUSTOMDICT, MSG_CUSTOMRECORD and MSG_RAWRECORD registered STATUS_NEVER until a use is found. Built in 2.10 as not handled yet in any status, following 2.09's rule that only server-only messages strike, because their direction is unknown. Every app shares these rules through SystemMessages::AddRules, and MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT's TimeStamp is sent as UTC year-month-day hour:minute:second

**Client messages:** MSG_PING, MSG_PING_RSP, MSG_SERVERMESSAGE, MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT, MSG_RAW_TEXT, MSG_CUSTOMDICT, MSG_CUSTOMRECORD, MSG_RAWRECORD

**Data sources**

- Generated registry

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: SendMessage of MSG_SERVERMESSAGE produces a frame with service 2, order 6 and a correct WSTR body
- [x] Unit: KickPlayer leaves the socket open until MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT is flushed
- [ ] Real client (once a character is in the world, or at the earliest stage it renders): a GM command (cs_server 'announce' or similar, owned by EXT/WLD) sends MSG_SERVERMESSAGE and the client visibly shows the text; 'kick' sends MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT and the client shows its disconnect dialog instead of a silent 'connection lost'

**Risks**

- Whether the client sends MSG_PING, and what it does with MSG_SERVERMESSAGE before entering the world, is unverified
- The reference server never sends MSG_FORCE_DISCONNECT (it shows a modal MSG_SERVERMESSAGE and closes instead), so the TimeStamp format and the client's reaction to the message are unverified until the real-client check

## 2.11 Twofish-256 OFB (FND-8 + LOG-3 cipher)

**Goal:** Cipher for Rec1, written from the spec.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 1.12

**Acceptance**

- [x] Twofish 256-bit (and 128-bit) KATs pass (TwofishTest: the zero-key vectors and the iterated tables for both key sizes, 256-bit added in this milestone; the cipher itself landed in 1.13)
- [x] OFB identity for 0, 1, 15, 16, 17 and 1000 bytes, with 128, 192 and 256-bit keys

### Detailed spec from FND-8: common/Cryptography part 2: Twofish-OFB; common/Utilities: zlib

The cipher used for Rec1 in MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP / MSG_USER_VALIDATE exists, and zlib-compressed client data can be inflated.

**Deliverables**

- src/common/Cryptography/Twofish.h/.cpp: written from the published Twofish spec (OpenSSL does not ship Twofish), 128-bit key block encrypt, plus an OFB mode wrapper with no padding
- deps/zlib/ vendored; src/common/Utilities/Compression.h/.cpp: Inflate(expectedSize) with a hard output cap, Deflate
- src/test/common/Cryptography/TwofishTest.cpp, src/test/common/Utilities/CompressionTest.cpp

**Acceptance**

- [x] Twofish-128 matches the spec's published known-answer vectors (zero key and plaintext, and the iterated table)
- [x] OFB encrypt then decrypt is identity for 0, 1, 15, 16, 17 and 1000 bytes
- [x] Inflate of a stream that decompresses past its cap fails cleanly (zip bomb guard)
- [x] Optional integration with AMBROSE_CLIENT_DIR: inflate a compressed Root.wad entry (e.g. LoginMessages.xml) and, for a 'BINd' entry, the zlib payload at offset 13
- [x] Real client: n/a (NET checks Rec1 against a live login)

**Risks**

- Twofish key and nonce derivation for Rec1 is NET's job; FND only guarantees the cipher is correct
- LoginMessages.xml fields PassKey3 and Rec1 exist (checked), but the exact hashing the client does is only known from the reference server and is unverified against a capture

### Detailed spec from LOG-3: KI login crypto primitives: Rec1, ClientKey1, PassKey3, session keys

The server can decrypt and encrypt Rec1 and verify ClientKey1 and PassKey3 exactly as the client computes them, all under unit test.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/shared/Cryptography/Twofish.{h,cpp} or a wrapper around the chosen library: Twofish-256 in OFB mode, no padding
- src/server/shared/Cryptography/Rec1.{h,cpp}: key = bytes 0x17+i for i in 0..31, with key[4]=sid&0xFF, key[5]=0, key[6]=sid>>8, key[8]=secs&0xFF, key[9]=secs>>16, key[12]=secs>>8, key[13]=secs>>24, key[14]=ms&0xFF, key[15]=ms>>8; IV = bytes 0xB6-i for i in 0..15; Decode and Encode
- src/server/shared/Cryptography/ClientKey.{h,cpp}: VerifyCK1(verifier, sid, secs, ms, ck1), which checks ck1 == base64(SHA-512(verifier || ascii("{sid}{secs}{ms}"))); GenerateSessionKey(), which returns base64(SHA-256(random || salt)) as 44 characters
- src/server/shared/Cryptography/PassKey3.{h,cpp}: base64(SHA-512(sessionKey || ascii("{sid}{secs}{ms}")))
- src/test/server/shared/Cryptography/{Rec1Test,ClientKeyTest,PassKey3Test}.cpp

**Data sources**

- Formulas studied from Imlight src/Imlight.CoreLib/Shared/Cryptography/{Rec1,ClientKey,PassKey3}.cs and docs/docs/modules/internals/auth/{auth,validation}.md (behavior only, reimplemented from the description)

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: Twofish passes the published Twofish 256-bit known-answer vectors
- [x] Unit: the Rec1 key and IV derivation for sid=0x1234, secs=0xAABBCCDD, ms=0x0123 yields the exact byte layout above, and Encode followed by Decode round-trips arbitrary lengths (OFB, no padding, output length equals input length)
- [x] Unit: VerifyCK1 accepts a vector computed independently in a test script from the formula and rejects a one-character change in the password, the sid or the milliseconds
- [x] Unit: PassKey3 output is 88 base64 characters, matching the 88-byte PassKey3 seen in the capture

**Risks**

- Settled on 2026-09-13: OpenSSL has SHA and base64 but no Twofish, so Botan 3 from vcpkg was chosen for Twofish and SHA-2 (see Stack in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- The number formatting in the salt (decimal, no separators, milliseconds not zero-padded) is inferred from the reference; if it is wrong, every login fails. Confirm with a real client in LOG-4.

## 2.12 Rec1, ClientKey1, PassKey3, session keys (LOG-3)

**Goal:** Login crypto matches the client.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 2.11, 1.08

**Acceptance**

- [x] Key/IV derivation for sid=0x1234 secs=0xAABBCCDD ms=0x0123 matches the layout (Rec1Test, with Twofish-256 from common/Cryptography)
- [x] VerifyCK1 accepts an independent vector and rejects a 1-char change (ClientKeyTest: vectors computed with Python hashlib for password, sid and milliseconds changes; the comparison is constant time)
- [x] PassKey3 is 88 base64 chars (PassKey3Test, against a Python hashlib vector; the salt formatting is still confirmed only by the real-client login of 2.14)

### Detailed spec from LOG-3: KI login crypto primitives: Rec1, ClientKey1, PassKey3, session keys

The server can decrypt and encrypt Rec1 and verify ClientKey1 and PassKey3 exactly as the client computes them, all under unit test.

**Deliverables**

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: Twofish passes the published Twofish 256-bit known-answer vectors

## 2.13 db_login schema, AccountMgr, console account create (LOG-2)

**Goal:** Accounts exist and operators can create them.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.08

**Acceptance**

- [x] verifier == base64(SHA-512(utf8(password))), 88 chars; duplicate username rejected case-insensitively (AccountMgrTest on MariaDB 10.11 and MySQL 8.0.46; with a verifier key configured the stored value is its AES-256-GCM seal and opens to the same verifier)
- [x] `account create test test` inserts once; rerun says it exists (AppSmoke.loginserver feeds the real binary's console; checked by hand on 2026-09-14: `account create test test` twice through a pipe created one row with an 88-character verifier and then reported that the account exists, and commands typed into a real Windows console ran)

### Detailed spec from LOG-2: db_login base schema, LoginDatabase statements and account creation

Accounts exist in MySQL and an operator can create one with a password, so authentication has something to check against.

**Deliverables**

- data/sql/updates/db_login/2026_09_14_01.sql: account (id BIGINT UNSIGNED PK, username VARCHAR(32) ascii_general_ci UNIQUE, verifier VARCHAR(160) ascii_bin holding base64(SHA-512(password)) or its AES-256-GCM seal, verifier_key_id TINYINT, email, security_level TINYINT, chat_mode TINYINT, locked TINYINT, purchased_slots INT, online TINYINT, joindate, last_login, last_ip, last_machine_id BIGINT UNSIGNED), account_banned (account_id, bandate, unbandate, bannedby, reason, active), ip_banned, machine_banned (machine_id, ...). base/db_login keeps only the updater tables until base/ is squashed
- src/server/database/Implementation/LoginDatabase.{h,cpp}: prepared statements LOGIN_SEL_ACCOUNT_BY_NAME, LOGIN_SEL_ACCOUNT_BY_ID, LOGIN_INS_ACCOUNT, LOGIN_UPD_LAST_LOGIN, LOGIN_SEL_BANS (account, ip, machine)
- src/server/game/Accounts/AccountMgr.{h,cpp} (sAccountMgr): CreateAccount, ChangePassword, SetSecurityLevel, Ban/Unban; username normalization and length rules
- src/server/apps/loginserver/Console: a minimal `account create <user> <pass>` and `account set gmlevel` console so login can be tested before the gameserver exists
- src/test/server/game/Accounts/AccountMgrTest.cpp

**Database tables**

- account
- account_banned
- ip_banned
- machine_banned
- updates
- updates_include

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: CreateAccount stores verifier == base64(SHA-512(utf8(password))), an 88-character string, and rejects a duplicate username case-insensitively
- [x] Unit: the updater applies data/sql/updates/db_login files in order and records them in updates
- [x] Manual: `account create test test` on the loginserver console inserts one row, and a second run reports that the account exists

**Risks**

- The verifier the client protocol needs (base64 SHA-512 of the password, unsalted) is password-equivalent: anyone who reads db_login can log in as any user. This is forced by the client's ClientKey1 scheme, so db_login needs strict access control. Settled on 2026-09-14: the verifier is encrypted at rest when verifier keys are configured (see Accounts and the console in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Layering: loginserver (an app) linking game/Accounts is allowed by apps -> game, but it drags the game library into the loginserver. The alternative is an AccountMgr kept in apps/loginserver plus a copy for cs_account. Settled on 2026-09-14: account management builds as the `accounts` library in game/Accounts, which the login server links (see Accounts and the console in doc/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 2.14 Authentication: AUTHEN_V3 -> AUTHEN_RSP + ADMIT_IND (LOG-4)

**Goal:** Valid credentials reach character select; bad ones are refused cleanly.

**Size:** M. **Depends on:** 2.09, 2.10, 2.12, 2.13

**Client messages:** MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP, MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND, MSG_USER_AUTHEN, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V2, MSG_WEB_AUTHEN, MSG_WEB_VALIDATE, MSG_SERVERMESSAGE

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: wrong sid, wrong CK1, banned machine, locked account each give their error and no session row (AuthHandlerTest over loopback, run locally against MariaDB 10.11 and MySQL 8 and in CI against MySQL 8, which also covers an unknown account, a banned address, a banned account, a disallowed revision and an oversized Rec1)
- [x] Real client: correct password reaches empty character select; log shows AUTHEN_RSP Error=0 and ADMIT_IND Status=1 (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client from the in-client login UI: Login.log shows 'sent MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP Error=0 and MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND Status=1', and the client log shows 'The LoginServer has admitted the user to the game' and an empty WizardCharacterSelect scene)
- [x] Real client: wrong password shows the invalid-login dialog and allows retry (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client: 'failed to authenticate as <account>: the password is wrong; sent MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP Error=AuthenFailed', the client showed 'Invalid username or password', and the correct password then logged in without restarting the client)
- [ ] Banned account is refused visibly

### Detailed spec from LOG-4: Authentication: MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3 -> MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP + MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND

A real client with valid credentials is authenticated and admitted to character select, and bad credentials, bans and revision mismatches are refused cleanly.

**Deliverables**

- src/server/apps/loginserver/Handlers/AuthHandler.cpp: HandleUserAuthenV3 decrypts Rec1 with the session's offer values and parses the plaintext as 'sid username ck1' (split on spaces; exactly 3 parts; sid must equal this session's id), then checks optional revision enforcement (Login.EnforceRevision, Login.AllowedRevision), account existence, account, IP and machine bans (MachineID GID), locked accounts, and CK1. Built with the account, its lock and all three bans read in one prepared query, run asynchronously and continued on the session's network thread when the database signals the result. A banned machine or address gives MachineBanned and a banned or locked account AccountBanned, as in the reference server, but bans are checked before the account and an account ban only after the password, so neither answer reveals that an account exists. A Rec1 over 512 bytes is refused before decryption, and Login.AllowedRevision takes a comma-separated list
- On success: generate a session key, store it in account_session, update last_login/last_ip/last_machine_id, seal the verifier again when its key id is not the active verifier key, and send MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP{Error=0, UserID=account id, Rec1=Rec1.Encode(sessionKey), Reason='', TimeStamp='', PayingUser=1, Flags=0, SupportID='', PublicPlayerName=''} then MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND{Status=1, PositionInQueue=0}; mark the session Authenticated
- On failure: MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP{Error=<code>, Reason=<text>} and keep the socket open for a retry, closing it after N failures (config Login.MaxAuthAttempts) with an IP lockout lasting Login.LockoutSeconds, like AzerothCore's WrongPass policy. Built with Reason set to the error's name, guesses counted per address in memory with IPv6 counted by /64 and attempts in flight reserved against the limit, and a session closed after Login.MaxAuthAttempts failures of any kind; a database that cannot answer gives Timeout and closes the session. Login.SessionKeyLifetime sets account_session's expiry
- Duplicate login policy (config Login.DuplicateLoginPolicy): an account already marked online either rejects with Error=AuthenFailed plus MSG_SERVERMESSAGE, or kicks the old session. Built on the login server's own live sessions, kicking the earlier session as soon as the new login's password is verified; the online column joins in once the game server marks players online in phase 4
- Login.EnforceRevision, Login.AllowedRevision, Login.MaxAuthAttempts, Login.LockoutSeconds and Login.DuplicateLoginPolicy are live settings read on each attempt, so a change applies without a restart (registered with 4.16 when it lands)
- MSG_USER_AUTHEN (13), MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V2 (22), MSG_WEB_AUTHEN (24) and MSG_WEB_VALIDATE (25) are answered with an AUTHEN_RSP failure and logged
- data/sql/updates/db_login/<date>_01.sql: account_session (account_id PK, machine_id, session_key CHAR(44), created, expires). Built as 2026_09_16_00.sql, following the repository's numbering, with session_key_hash CHAR(44) holding the base64 SHA-256 of the key, so the table holds no usable key
- src/server/apps/loginserver/Server/AuthResult.h: error code constants

**Client messages:** MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V3, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP, MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND, MSG_USER_AUTHEN, MSG_USER_AUTHEN_V2, MSG_WEB_AUTHEN, MSG_WEB_VALIDATE, MSG_SERVERMESSAGE

**Data sources**

- Sniffer capture traffic.log lines 1-3 (observed field values)
- Imlight src/Imlight.CoreLib/Auth/UserAuthenticator.cs and Login/Services/AuthenticatorService.cs (behavior only)

**Database tables**

- account
- account_session
- account_banned
- ip_banned
- machine_banned

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: a fake session with known sid, secs and ms, fed a Rec1 built by the test from 'sid user ck1', authenticates; a wrong sid in the plaintext, a wrong CK1, a banned machine id and a locked account each give the expected error code and no session row (AuthHandlerTest takes the sid, seconds and milliseconds from the SessionOffer a real LoginSession sends over loopback)
- [x] Unit: changing Login.MaxAuthAttempts on a running loginserver applies to the next attempt without a restart (AuthHandlerTest reloads the config file between two wrong passwords, and the lower limit closes the session and locks the address out)
- [x] Real client (in-client login UI, no -U): the correct password moves to the character select screen (empty list for a new account) with no error dialog; the server log shows AUTHEN_V3, AUTHEN_RSP Error=0 and ADMIT_IND Status=1, matching capture lines 1-3 (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client from the in-client login UI: Login.log shows 'sent MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP Error=0 and MSG_USER_ADMIT_IND Status=1', and the client log shows 'The LoginServer has admitted the user to the game' and an empty WizardCharacterSelect scene)
- [x] Real client: a wrong password shows the client's invalid-login dialog and allows a retry without restarting the client (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client: 'failed to authenticate as <account>: the password is wrong; sent MSG_USER_AUTHEN_RSP Error=AuthenFailed', the client showed 'Invalid username or password', and the correct password then logged in without restarting the client)
- [ ] Real client: an account banned via account_banned is refused with a visible message and never reaches character select
- [ ] Sniffer (optional): with the proxy in front, the AUTHEN_RSP Rec1 decrypts to a 44-character base64 key

**Risks**

- Error code values (AuthenFailed=0x3B689180, AccountBanned=0x538FBC0, MachineBanned=0x44FB7BF8, Timeout=0x512C42FF, ErrorNoLock=0x67DD13EA, ...) come from the reference and look like string-ID hashes; which client dialog each one shows is unverified.
- How the client builds CK1 on the -U '..<id> <PasswordHash> <user>' launch path, as opposed to the in-client login UI, is unverified; the two may differ in whether the client hashes the password itself.
- Flags (account permission bits such as chat and gifting) are sent as 0 in the capture; their meanings are unverified.

## 2.15 Login AFK timeout and shutdown notice (LOG-14)

**Goal:** Polite idle drop and shutdown notice.

**Size:** S. **Depends on:** 2.14

**Client messages:** MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK, MSG_DISCONNECT_LOGIN_AFK, MSG_LOGINSERVERSHUTDOWN

**Acceptance**

- [x] Fake clock: idle session closed; MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK every 30 s keeps it (LoginAfkTest moves LoginMgr's clock forward over loopback sessions)
- [ ] Real client: AFK message rather than connection-lost; shutdown notice shown

### Detailed spec from LOG-14: Login AFK timeout and graceful shutdown notice

Idle clients at the login screen are dropped politely, and a login server shutdown tells connected clients instead of silently cutting them off.

**Deliverables**

- LoginSocket idle tracking: MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK (BadgeNameID ignored) and any other client message reset the timer; after Login.AfkTimeout send MSG_DISCONNECT_LOGIN_AFK{Warning} and close; the timer is suspended once CharacterSelected. Built in LoginSession, checked once a second from its network thread's update against LoginMgr's clock and skipped while a login is being checked; keepalives do not count as activity, Login.AfkTimeout = 0 disables the drop, and MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK is accepted from connection through character selection
- Shutdown: on SIGINT or console `server shutdown`, send MSG_LOGINSERVERSHUTDOWN{Message} to every session, then close after a grace delay. Built as LoginShutdown::NotifyAndDrain, run when the app stops from a signal or the console's `shutdown` command: it closes the listener first so no client arrives unnotified, sends Message=0 to every accepted session over the new SocketMgr::ForEachSocket, closes each once its notice is flushed, and stops waiting as soon as every notice is written or every connection has ended
- conf/dist/loginserver.conf.dist: Login.AfkTimeout, Login.AfkWarning, Login.ShutdownGrace. They are live settings read at each timer check, so a change applies without a restart (registered with 4.16 when it lands). Built in src/server/apps/loginserver/loginserver.conf.dist, with Login.AfkWarning as the Warning byte sent and Login.ShutdownGrace = 0 sending no notice

**Client messages:** MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK, MSG_DISCONNECT_LOGIN_AFK, MSG_LOGINSERVERSHUTDOWN

**Acceptance**

- [x] Unit: with a fake clock, a session with no traffic for AfkTimeout seconds is closed, while one sending MSG_LOGIN_NOT_AFK every 30s is kept
- [x] Unit: with a fake clock, lowering Login.AfkTimeout on a running loginserver closes an idle session at the new timeout
- [ ] Real client: leave the client on character select past the timeout; it shows the client's AFK disconnect message rather than a generic connection-lost error
- [x] Real client: stopping the loginserver while on character select shows a server-shutdown notice (2026-09-17, retail r806919 client on the character creation screens reached from character select: 'Sent MSG_LOGINSERVERSHUTDOWN to 1 session(s)', and the client showed 'Server has been brought down for maintenance. Please try again later!')

**Risks**

- The Warning byte (warn versus disconnect) and the Message UINT for shutdown are both unverified; the reference sends Warning=1 with a '???' note.
