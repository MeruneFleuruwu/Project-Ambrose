<!-- Project Ambrose by Imjustchico: The separate track other people work from: what it holds, the folders it may touch, and the open items. -->

# Contributor track

The phases in doc/ROADMAP.md are built in order by the maintainer's own agents, one milestone at a time. Nobody else works from them: two people building the same milestone lose track of each other, and a milestone half-built by someone else cannot be reviewed against its own acceptance checks.

So everything from outside lands here instead. This track holds work that helps the project finish sooner and cannot collide with a milestone: it adds files in folders no milestone builds in, it needs no change to a phase file, and it can be reviewed on its own.

Ask in the Discord before you start if anything here is unclear: https://discord.gg/Dx6ACDUj6N. It is also where a finding gets discussed before it is written up.

Read this document first, then contrib/findings/README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md. Working with an AI assistant is expected here: contrib/AI-START-HERE.md is a prompt to paste into yours, and it carries what that assistant needs to know about this repository before it writes anything.

## The rule that makes it safe

A change on this track touches only these paths:

| Path | What goes there |
|---|---|
| `contrib/tools/<name>/` | A self-contained tool of your own, in any language, that reads a user's own installation or an Ambrose server and prints or writes its own output |
| `contrib/findings/` | One proven claim per file about how the game behaves, in the shape contrib/findings/README.md gives, which Ambrose later verifies or refutes |
| `contrib/notes/` | Longer research writing that is not one claim: a survey, a walkthrough of a system, a summary of what you tried |
| `contrib/proposals/` | A proposal for something in the phases, as a document. The maintainer folds an accepted one into the roadmap; you never edit a phase file yourself |
| `apps/clientdriver/scenarios/` | Scenarios for the client driver, which are data, not code |
| `data/sql/updates/pending_db_world/` | World rows you authored yourself, such as a table of door destinations, as a dated update file that the maintainer moves into `data/sql/updates/db_world/` when it is merged |
| `data/fuzz/` | Seed inputs for the fuzzers that already exist |
| `doc/guides/` | Guides: running on a distribution, a graphics card, a language, a setup that needed a workaround |
| `contrib/locale/` | Translations of Ambrose's own text, never the game's |
| `contrib/fixtures/` | Sample data in the shapes the panel and the servers exchange, hand-written or generated and never captured: status responses, app lists, log records, metric series |
| `contrib/schemas/` | JSON Schemas for those shapes, and the corpora with expected answers a loader or parser is tested against |

Nothing else. Not `src/`, not `apps/` beyond the scenarios folder, not `doc/` beyond guides, not the phase files, not doc/ARCHITECTURE.md, doc/DESIGN.md, doc/PANEL.md, doc/UI-STACK.md, doc/ROADMAP.md, CMake files, CI files or the vcpkg manifest. A pull request that touches anything else is closed with a pointer to this document, because it cannot be merged without stopping a milestone in flight.

`python apps/ci/ci_contrib_paths.py --range upstream/main...HEAD` says whether a change stays inside the track. Three dots, and the branch on the remote your pull request targets. A clone of your own fork has no `upstream` remote, so add it once with `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Justchicoo/Project-Ambrose.git` and run `git fetch upstream` before the check, or it fails with `unknown revision`. Never your own `main`: a local `main` that is stale, or an upstream one that moved on while you worked, makes the check flag dozens of files you never touched. Before your first commit, `python apps/ci/ci_contrib_paths.py --paths <files>` checks files that are not committed yet. `python apps/ci/ci_findings.py` checks that every finding carries what Ambrose needs to prove it. CI runs the findings check on every pull request, and the path check on every pull request from a fork; on a branch in this repository the `contrib` label turns it on from the next push, because only a `ci:` label makes the labelling itself start a run.

## What every change needs

- **One thing at a time.** One tool, one note, one scenario, one guide. A pull request that does two things gets split.
- **Say where it came from.** Your own observation of your own installation, your own capture of your own session, a public source you name, or your own reasoning. Never a file from the game client, never code from another server project, and never text from a wiki or a site without naming its licence and waiting for the maintainer to accept it.
- **Say how it was checked.** A tool says what it was run against and what it printed. A note says how it was observed and what would disprove it. A scenario says it ran and what it asserted. SQL says the query that shows the rows are right.
- **No game files, ever.** No archive, asset, text, image or dump from the client, and nothing generated from one that carries its content. A tool reads the user's own installation at run time; that is the line.
- **Keep the house style.** Every file starts with the Project Ambrose branding header and a one-line brief, and carries no other comments. UTF-8 with no byte order mark, LF endings, no trailing whitespace, ending in a newline, which is what `python apps/codestyle/codestyle.py` enforces and it must pass. Text outside ASCII is fine where the content needs it, such as a translation.
- **Name your tool in the commit.** AI tools are expected here; add the trailer CONTRIBUTING.md asks for.
- **A tool brings its own dependencies.** Pin them inside `contrib/tools/<name>/`, and do not add anything to the repository's own manifests.

## The biggest way to help: proven findings

Ambrose is built on data it has proven. The type registry came from running the client's own program; the name tables came from the install's own files; the wire format was checked byte for byte against captures. Nothing is believed because it sounds right, because one wrong fact costs more later than it saved.

Most of what the game does is still undocumented here, and that is the work that shortens this project the most. A finding is one claim about how the game behaves, written so somebody else can repeat it and so Ambrose can prove or refute it later with its own tools. `contrib/findings/README.md` gives the shape, the fields and the rules; `python apps/ci/ci_findings.py` checks a file before you send it.

Three things make a finding worth merging:

- **It could be wrong.** Say what would disprove it. A claim nothing could falsify is an opinion.
- **Somebody else can repeat it.** The steps name the tool, the screen or the capture, not "I remember seeing".
- **It carries no game data.** Offsets, field names, sizes, counts and hashes are facts about the data and are welcome. The bytes themselves never are.

A merged finding is marked `claimed` and nothing is built on it. When a milestone needs it, Ambrose re-derives it with its own capture, its own decode or a test written to fail if the claim is wrong, and the file records the outcome as `verified` with the milestone that proved it, or `refuted` with what actually happens. Both outcomes are worth merging: a refuted finding stops the next person chasing it.

A refuted finding is as welcome as a verified one and is merged the same way. What is not welcome is a claim nothing could disprove, because it costs the next person the time it saved you. A finding that carries a check a machine can run is worth more again, since it is proven the next time the suite runs rather than the next time somebody has an afternoon; what that check looks like is not settled yet, which is what C-22 proposes and C-51 builds, so until then a finding says in words what would prove or disprove it.

## The open items

Each item is worth doing, needs nothing from the phases, and lands inside the track. Take one by opening a pull request; say in it which item you took. The F items are findings, which follow contrib/findings/README.md; the C items are code, data, guides and proposals. None of them is reserved: if two people send the same item, both are read and the better evidence wins, so say in your pull request what you are starting.

| Id | Item | Where it lands | Why it helps |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-01 | Combat: the order a duel resolves in, what each side sends and when, and what the client shows at each step | `contrib/findings/combat/` | Phase 11 is the largest phase in the plan and the least documented. Every proven step shortens it |
| F-02 | Combat: how a spell's cost, accuracy, damage and effects are expressed in the client's own data | `contrib/findings/combat/` | Decides what the server must store and check for every card |
| F-03 | Combat: pips, power pips and shadow pips, how they are gained, spent and shown | `contrib/findings/combat/` | Small, self-contained, and needed before any duel is fought |
| F-04 | Quests: what a quest record holds, how a goal is expressed, how progress is reported and how rewards are named | `contrib/findings/quests/` | Phase 7 reads these; notes turn a month of guessing into a week of building |
| F-05 | Quests: how the client decides a quest helper's arrow and the quest log's grouping | `contrib/findings/quests/` | The visible half of questing, which the server has to feed |
| F-06 | World: how a zone's objects, triggers and doors are laid out in the client's own files | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phase 4 and 5 stream these; the format is known only in outline |
| F-07 | World: what a teleporter carries, given that the type data gives `ResTeleport` no properties at all | `contrib/findings/world/` | Blocks door destinations, which is why C-01 exists as authored data instead |
| F-08 | Protocol: what each unhandled login message means, above all MSG_USER_VALIDATE, and what a correct answer looks like | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Milestone 5.06 needs it, and it is what makes the launcher's automatic login work |
| F-09 | Protocol: the session offer's encryption block, which the client reads and Ambrose does not yet send | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | The client logs a complaint on every connection today; nobody has decoded the block |
| F-10 | Protocol: how the client behaves when a message it expects never arrives, per screen | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Tells the server which timeouts matter and what a stuck screen means |
| F-11 | Objects: which classes the client serialises with which flags, beyond what the type dump states | `contrib/findings/objects/` | The codec is byte-exact on 42 captures; the next hundred classes are unproven |
| F-12 | Client: what each launch option really does on this revision, beyond the documented list | `contrib/findings/client/` | Two of them already changed how the launcher and the test driver work |
| F-13 | Client: which files the client writes, when, and what it keeps between sessions | `contrib/findings/client/` | Ambrose promises it never writes inside your install; knowing what the client writes keeps that promise honest |
| F-14 | Patching: how the retail patcher names, requests and verifies a file | `contrib/findings/patching/` | Phase 16 serves patches; today the protocol is known only in outline |
| F-15 | Data: what changed between two client revisions, as a list of archives, zones and locale files | `contrib/findings/data/` | Milestone 3.23 follows KingsIsle's revisions and needs to know what a revision actually changes |
| F-16 | Pets, housing, crafting, fishing or gardening: any one system, its data and its messages | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phases 13 and 15 hold the least documented systems in the plan |
| F-17 | Protocol: the keepalive body the client sends and expects, its cadence, and what it does when a reply is late or malformed | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Ambrose's own error log closes real sessions over a six-byte structure one side has wrong, and nobody has proven which |
| F-18 | Protocol: the session offer's encryption block byte by byte, and what the client does with each field | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | F-09 is this from the client's side; this is the server's, and the client complains on every connection today |
| F-19 | Protocol: what the client does when the same account signs in twice, and what the first session is told | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | The login server already refuses the second sign-in; what the first client shows is unproven |
| F-20 | Combat: the turn timer, the planning phase and the round boundary, as messages with their timing | `contrib/findings/combat/` | Phase 11 is the largest phase in the plan, and the round boundary is where every other combat fact hangs |
| F-21 | Combat: what the client is told about an enemy's intent before a round resolves, and when | `contrib/findings/combat/` | Decides whether the server must choose mob actions before or during resolution |
| F-22 | Combat: a player disconnecting mid-duel and returning, from both sides | `contrib/findings/combat/` | The case every combat implementation gets wrong, and the cheapest one to observe |
| F-23 | Items: how a stat on an item reaches the character sheet, and the order effects apply | `contrib/findings/objects/` | Phase 8 stores these, and the order is what makes two servers disagree about the same gear |
| F-24 | Items: what a treasure card is on the wire and how the side deck is expressed | `contrib/findings/objects/` | Small, self-contained, and a known gap in phases 8 and 11 |
| F-25 | Economy: what the client sends to buy and to sell, and what a bazaar listing carries | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phase 12 builds the bazaar, and a ledger needs to know what a legitimate mutation looks like |
| F-26 | Social: what a friend list entry holds and how presence changes reach other clients | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Phase 12, and it is observable with two clients and no server work |
| F-27 | Social: how a trade is offered, locked and confirmed, and what each side sees at each step | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Trading is the most abused system in every game of this kind, and the exact lock steps are what make it safe |
| F-28 | Instances: how an instance is created, joined and reset, including the sigil countdown | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phase 14 needs it and phase 12 touches it |
| F-29 | Housing: how a layout is stored and what the client sends when a decoration is moved | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phase 15 holds the least documented systems in the plan |
| F-30 | Gardening and fishing: the tick model, what is stored and what the client is told on return | `contrib/findings/world/` | Same phase, and both are timers, which is a shape the server has to own |
| F-31 | Pets: how talents are chosen, stored and shown | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phase 13, and the manifestation rules are pure data |
| F-32 | Chat: the filter levels, the channels and how menu chat's vocabulary is expressed | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Needed before moderation, and it decides what the server must validate |
| F-33 | Mounts: how one is applied, and what another client sees | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Named in the roadmap's own gap list as having no milestone |
| F-34 | Zones: what spawn data says about respawn timers and patrol paths | `contrib/findings/world/` | The roadmap records that no milestone reads collision, navmesh or spawn data yet |
| F-35 | Zones: how the client asks to change zone, and gates, recall and zone hops | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phases 4 and 5 stream these; the request side is known only in outline |
| F-36 | Movement: the client's update rate, its interpolation, and how much correction it accepts without visibly snapping | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Decides the server's move validation budget, which nothing has measured |
| F-37 | Client: what each locale file drives, and how the client picks its language | `contrib/findings/client/` | The client ships eight locales and the panel's own localisation has to match what the client shows |
| F-38 | Data: what the type dump's opaque classes actually are, one class at a time | `contrib/findings/objects/` | Each one proven is one fewer blind spot in the codec |
| F-39 | Patching: how the retail patcher handles concurrency, resume and a corrupted file | `contrib/findings/patching/` | Phase 16 serves patches, and the failure paths are what a server has to survive |
| F-40 | Revisions: how to prove a change between two client revisions is real, rather than inferring it from a size | `contrib/findings/data/` | Milestone 3.23 follows revisions; F-15 asks what changed, this asks how you prove it |
| C-01 | Door destinations for Wizard City: every doorway a player can walk through, with the zone it leads to | `data/sql/updates/pending_db_world/` | `ResTeleport` carries no properties, so this table has to be authored. Phase 10 needs it and cannot generate it |
| C-11 | Fuzz seeds: inputs that made a decoder work hard, from your own captures | `data/fuzz/` | The fuzzers exist; they are only as good as their corpus |
| C-17 | Notes on how the client picks and shows realms after login | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | Milestone 4.03 builds the realm registry and has to match this behaviour |
| C-48 | Door destinations for a world beyond Wizard City | `data/sql/updates/pending_db_world/` | C-01's shape, more of it: the teleport class carries no properties, so this can only be authored |
| F-41 | Message catalog, one finding per service: from the message definitions in your own install, the service's id and name, every message with its order, and each message's field names and types, as facts and never bytes | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | The handler table for every phase after 3 starts from this; today only the login server's exists. Cite `bindecode --sweep` and name the service in the file name |
| F-42 | Zone catalog: every zone the install's data names, its id, its world, and the archives it references | `contrib/findings/world/` | Phases 4 and 5 need the list before they need the geometry |
| F-43 | Template catalog: how many ObjectData templates exist per class, and the base classes the top hundred share | `contrib/findings/data/` | Says how big the world database has to be before a row is written |
| F-44 | Locale catalog: which `.lang` files the install carries, their key counts, and which locales the client ships, from `localetool` | `contrib/findings/client/` | Decides what the launcher's locale option can offer |
| F-45 | Spell data shape: the fields a spell template carries, with types, and the count of spells per school, from the dump and the templates | `contrib/findings/combat/` | The static half of F-02, doable without a duel |
| F-46 | Quest data shape: the fields of a quest template, the goal classes present and how many of each | `contrib/findings/quests/` | The static half of F-04 |
| F-47 | The type dump's flag vocabulary: which flag bits occur on properties, how often, and on which classes | `contrib/findings/objects/` | The static half of F-11 |
| F-48 | The client's own configuration: every key `config.xml` and `preferences.xml` carry, with the values a fresh install writes | `contrib/findings/client/` | The launcher splices only what it needs; this says what else is there |
| F-49 | The revision files: what `Bin/revision.dat` and the launcher's own files hold, byte layout by offset and meaning, never content | `contrib/findings/client/` | 3.23 follows revisions and needs to read these without guessing |
| F-50 | Which archives each world's zones draw from, as a table of zone to archive | `contrib/findings/world/` | Tells the patch server what a zone entry needs downloaded |
| F-51 | A second observation of F-12: repeat its experiment on your own install with your own hashes and record `verified` or `refuted` | `contrib/findings/client/` | A finding with two observers is worth more than two findings |
| F-52 | The message definitions' own metadata: protocol version, description, and any field the definitions carry beyond name, type and order | `contrib/findings/protocol/` | The handshake checks none of it today; it should know what is there |
| F-53 | Which classes the type dump marks as having no reflected properties, grouped by base class, with counts | `contrib/findings/objects/` | The static, countable half of F-38 |
| F-54 | The sizes and counts of every archive in the install: files per archive, compressed and uncompressed totals, as a table | `contrib/findings/data/` | The patch server plans transfers against this |
| F-55 | What a name table row holds: the fields the extractor reads from each name table, checked against the dump | `contrib/findings/data/` | The world database's name columns are shaped by it |
| C-66 | A guide to building on Windows from nothing, walked, with the installer prerequisites and the pitfalls | `doc/guides/` | The Linux guide exists; the platform the project is built on does not have one |
| C-67 | A guide to reading a capture with the metadata decoder: what a healthy login looks like as frames, frame by frame | `doc/guides/` | C-02 built the tool; a guide makes its output legible |
| C-68 | A launcher troubleshooting guide: the configuration the client silently ignores, the fullscreen traps, and the page it opens after a refused login | `doc/guides/` | Every one of those was learned the hard way and is written down only in commit messages |
| C-69 | An audit of every option in every `.conf.dist` against `doc/config/*.md`: documented but absent, present but undocumented, defaults that disagree, with the script that found them | `contrib/tools/` | Configuration drift is invisible until an operator hits it |
| C-70 | An audit of every log category used in `src/` against the guide's table and the shipped `.conf.dist` loggers, with the script | `contrib/tools/` | A category nothing routes is a message nobody sees |
| C-71 | A checker for the roadmap files: every dependency names a milestone that exists, ids are unique, sizes match the counting rule, and a ticked box carries evidence | `contrib/tools/` | The maintainer runs one from a scratchpad; the project should own one |
| C-72 | A dead-link checker for `doc/`, relative links and anchors, with its results as a note | `contrib/tools/` | Documents move; links do not follow them |
| C-73 | An audit of `vcpkg.json` and `package.json` against `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`: every dependency listed, every licence right, nothing listed that is no longer used | `contrib/notes/` | The notices file is a promise the repository keeps by hand |
| C-74 | A capture-free replay corpus for C-23: manifests of frame sequences in the shape the replayer reads, for a login, a wrong password and a keepalive exchange, built from the message definitions rather than a capture | `contrib/fixtures/` | The replayer exists; it has nothing to replay |
| C-75 | A second observer for any merged tool: run it against your own install or server, record what it printed, and file what disagreed with its README as a note | `contrib/notes/` | A tool that two people ran is worth more than one with a green self-test |

### The second list

The first list is mostly taken, and what remains of it waits on servers that do not exist yet: a finding about combat or the world needs a duel or a zone to observe, and Ambrose cannot show either. The rows from F-41 and C-56 onward are the second list, written after a batch in which most findings came back as records that nothing was known, for exactly that reason. These ask for what a contributor with a clone of the repository, Python and their own installation can actually produce, and each carries a contract so a scaffold cannot pass for the item.

- **Needs.** F-41 to F-55: your own installation and the built `bindecode`, `localetool` or `typeextract`; nothing else. C-56 to C-64 and C-69 to C-75: a clone and Python. C-65 to C-68: a clone, and for C-66 a Windows machine walked from nothing. C-75: whichever tool or install the item names.
- **Delivers.** A finding delivers facts about the data, names, counts, ids, offsets and types, never content, with the tool invocation that produced them so the maintainer can re-derive them. A schema delivers the schema, at least one fixture that validates against it, and a check that runs. A corpus delivers the inputs and the expected answers side by side, in one file or two named alike, so a parser is tested by comparison rather than by assertion. An audit delivers the script and its findings, both. A guide delivers a walked path and says which steps were walked.
- **Proven by.** A finding is proven when the maintainer's own tools produce the same facts from a different install. A schema or corpus is proven when the servers' or panel's own tests load it and pass. An audit is proven when its script runs clean on `main` and its findings are reproduced by a second run. A guide is proven when a second person walks it.
- **Refused.** A finding whose claim is about this repository rather than the game. A schema with no fixture. A corpus with inputs and no expected answers. A guide that was not walked and does not say so. Any of the above that names a path or an option that does not exist.

An item stays listed until its pull request is merged. Ask before starting something not on the list: the answer is usually yes if it lands in the paths above.

## What happens to your work

Notes, proposals and guides are read by the agents building the milestones they touch, and cited in the milestone that uses them. A tool stays yours in `contrib/tools/`, and if the project later needs it in the servers, it is rebuilt inside `src/` under the architecture's rules, with your note kept. Scenarios, SQL and fuzz seeds are used where they are. Everything merged is MIT, as LICENSE says.

### Started, still open

These carry a first delivery and stay listed above because the item is not what landed: C-01 has its `zone_teleport` table (#55) and no rows; C-11 has its seed folder's README (#56) and no seeds; F-12 has a finding that Ambrose's launcher applies its options and leaves the install untouched (#53), not yet what each of the client's own options does.
