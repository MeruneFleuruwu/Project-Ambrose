 * One command a CommandScript offers: the word it answers to, the level an account needs before it is even told the command exists, whether it may be run from a console as well as in game, its one-line help, whether its arguments are secret enough to keep out of a log, what it does, and the commands nested under it, so '.character gold 500' is the gold command inside the character group and the table is a tree rather than a list of strings to pull apart.
